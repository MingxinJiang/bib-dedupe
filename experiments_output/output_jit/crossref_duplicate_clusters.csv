1,000690,A process model for software maintenance,"Moreton, Robert",eng,,100--104,2,5,1990,Journal of Information Technology,10.1057/JIT.1990.19,article,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jit.1990.19,689
1,002398,A Process Model for Software Maintenance,"Moreton, Robert",eng,"This paper draws on work undertaken for the Butler Cox Productivity Enhancement Programme (PEP) to describe a process model which will provide a basis for overcoming the problems of cost and complexity associated with software maintenance. PEP is a continuous program that is open to organizations wishing to measure and improve systems development and productivity. The paper argues that for maintenance work to be effective, it is vital to control the input to the process — the procedure by which change requests are notified and managed in the first place. The procedure of change management is followed by impact analysis, system release planning, change design, implementation, testing and system release/integration. These steps, which occur sequentially, are supported by a further activity that continues concurrently - progress monitoring. The conclusion of the paper is that a coordinated program, effective across the whole maintenance process and designed to control changes to the system, will become more and more critical as the complexity of the system increases. Formal procedures are essential to ensure that software is not degraded and to provide an audit facility. At the same time there are several automated change and control packages now available that could help to reduce administrative overheads and increase control over system changes.",100--104,2,5,1990,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629000500206,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629000500206,,,2397

10,002085,The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Information Officer: The Strategic Partnership,"Gupta, Yash P.",eng,"Information technology (IT) has become a strategic resource for many firms today. Coordination of this resource requires strong leadership and cooperation within the firm. The relationship of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the Chief Information Officer (CIO) is crucial for the effective, successful utilization of IT for competitive advantage. This paper first explores the CIO position, giving reasons for its development, tracing its evolution, and pinpointing certain responsibilities associated with the position. The paper then highlights the CIO's concerns and identifies the future implications for the CIO. The second portion of the paper takes the CEO's perspective towards IT and the CIO's position. Special attention is directed towards describing the CEO's perspective on the CIO's qualifications, addressing the problem of overblown CEO expectations for the CIO position, and discussing ‘old-line’ CEOs’ attitudes towards IT and the CIO position. Also addressed is the exploration of the common CEO perception of the CIO as an ‘empire builder’ and an analysis of the CEO's perspective on the future need for a CIO position. Finally the paper focuses on developing this ‘strategic partnership’ between the CIO and the CEO. Suggestions are provided for the CIO and the CEO to help achieve this ideal partnership. Although these suggestions are not all conclusive, they are critical to the ‘partnership’.",128--139,3-4,6,1991,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/0268396291006003-404,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0268396291006003-404,,,2084

11,001959,Evaluation of Information Systems: Is Development in the Processing Company,"Symons, Veronica",eng,"Information systems (IS) are centrally important to the modern form of organization, but their impacts are not yet well understood. IS development is, in general, grounded in a quasi-scientific ‘formal-rationalism’, oriented chiefly towards technical aspects; yet the accompanying difficulties in implementation are due for the most part to ‘people problems’. In defining an IS as a computer system embedded in an organization, this paper argues that information systems are not purely technical systems, but also social systems. Consequently, work in this area necessitates an interactionist approach, taking the effects of information technology to be a product of neither the technical nor social aspects alone, but of their interaction. Evaluation is shaped, similarly, by the interaction of technique with social process: it is a multi-stage activity running through IS development. The history of IS development in the Processing Company illustrates these views and highlights the dysfunctionality of the formal-rational perspective.",194--204,4,5,1990,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629000500404,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629000500404,,,1958

The adoption of electronic markets in an industry has a disintermediation potential because it can create a direct link between the producer and the consumer (without the need for the intermediation role of distributors). Electronic markets lower the searches cost allowing customers to choose between more providers. This ultimately reduces both the costs for the customer and the profits for the producer. In this paper it is contended that electronic markets on the Internet have the opposite effect, resulting in an increase in intermediators. It introduces transaction streams which model how transactions are being conducted and helps explain the types of new intermediators that are appearing on the Internet. The mechanisms by which companies are exploring ways of extending transaction streams are also described. To illustrate the model, the paper briefly analyses transaction streams in the insurance industry and provides examples related to confidence in electronic commerce.",3--16,1,15,2000,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839620001500102,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839620001500102,,,2156

20,002440,An Introduction to Integrated Project Support Environments,"Brown, Alan W.",eng,"In the last few years the rapidly expanding application of computer technology has brought the problems of software production increasingly to the fore, and it is widely accepted that current software development techniques are unable to produce high quality software at the rate required to keep pace with this. To try to improve this imbalance, the field of software engineering has been advanced as a possible solution, attempting to apply the formal methods of an engineering discipline to software design and implementation. One of the most promising areas to be developed in this field is that of integrated project support environments (IPSEs), which attempt to spread the focus of attention during software development from the coding stage to embrace the whole development cycle, from initial requirements specification through to operational maintenance. These environments hope to improve production efficiency and quality by providing a complete set of support tools to help with each stage of software development, and to supply the necessary tool integration to ensure a smooth transition of use between these tools. This paper provides an introduction to IPSEs through analysing the motivation for providing integrated support for the production of software, and describing something of the evolution of environments for software development. This provides the context for describing current and future research trends in this area.",194--204,3,3,1988,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839628800300308,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839628800300308,,,2439

22,002353,Implementing Interorganizational it Systems: Lessons from a Call Centre Project,"Boddy, David",eng,"The growing power of computer-telephony integration (CTI) systems is encouraging many companies to create call centres. These deal with a growing range of business processes and, in doing so, can be used to challenge established organizational arrangements. The range of human and management issues that need to be dealt with has yet to become clear. Some insights into these are offered from a study of one call centre over 2 years, from shortly before its physical introduction to the present day. These empirical observations are set within the wider literature on organizational change and information technology (IT), particularly the processual and integrationist perspectives. The paper uses the evidence of the case to elaborate the integrationist model so that it reflects the areas of human action more fully.

This paper, based on a survey of 146 large firms, outlines the current status of CABIS and their usage pattern. It was found that although two-thirds of sample firms have specific computer application systems for capital budgeting, most CABIS are relatively unsophisticated and less than adequate in providing the information and decision support capabilities required to use sophisticated capital budgeting techniques effectively. In particular, the barrier and problems encountered in the use of probabilistic risk analysis were explored. Implications of these findings are discussed.",119--128,2,11,1996,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629601100203,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629601100203,,,2121

The results establish a baseline for future studies. They show widespread penetration of IT courses in general MBAs, but the amount and type of content they provide is only sufficient to give students a partial preparation for the general management task with respect to IT. There is an internal expectation gap between what IT academics view as core and the time and space available in the Master of Business Administration (MBA) curriculum. There is an external expectation gap between the issues currently of concern to business and the topics taught. At present the gap is widest in respect of business managers’ concerns about information infrastructure and organizational learning. The evidence suggests that neither expectation gap will decline over the next 5 years and may increase. We conclude that there is a need for increased provision in the curriculum. Recommendations are made for two core courses, with more attention to be given to topics of current concern to business managers.",261--276,4,12,1997,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629701200403,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629701200403,,,1836

It compares the design of systems for computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) in Scandinavia and Japan with particular attention to the influence of culture on the resulting products. Two case studies are presented to illustrate the argument that culture is an important factor in technology design, despite commonly held assumptions about the neutrality and objectivity of science and technology. The paper further proposes an explanation for why, despite similar technical backgrounds and research interests, CSCW design is conducted differently and produces different results in Denmark and Japan. It argues that, by looking at CSCW systems as texts which reflect the context of their production and the society from which they come, we may be better able to understand the transformations that operate when these texts are ‘read’ in the contexts of their implementation.",259--272,4,13,1998,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629801300405,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629801300405,,,2402

46,000067,A Critical Analysis of Decision Support Systems Research Revisited: The Rise of Design Science,"Arnott, David and Pervan, Graham",eng,"In 2005 the Journal of Information Technology article ‘A critical analysis of decision support systems research’ analyzed 1020 decision support systems (DSS) articles from 1990 to 2003. Since 2003 business intelligence (BI) and business analytics have gained popularity in practice. In theory and research the period since 2003 has seen a change in the decision-making theory orthodoxy and the codification and acceptance of design science. To investigate the changes in the DSS field, a number of expectations were derived from previous literature analyses. These expectations were assessed using bibliometric content analysis.

46,001129,A Critical Analysis of Decision Support Systems Research Revisited: The Rise of Design Science,"Arnott, David and Pervan, Graham",eng,"In 2005 the Journal of Information Technology article ‘A critical analysis of decision support systems research’ analyzed 1020 decision support systems (DSS) articles from 1990 to 2003. Since 2003 business intelligence (BI) and business analytics have gained popularity in practice. In theory and research the period since 2003 has seen a change in the decision-making theory orthodoxy and the codification and acceptance of design science. To investigate the changes in the DSS field, a number of expectations were derived from previous literature analyses. These expectations were assessed using bibliometric content analysis. The article sample to 2010 now includes 1466 articles from 16 journals. The analysis of the expectations yields mixed results for the DSS field.

49,002139,A Framework for Evaluating Organizational Choice and Process Redesign Issues,"Brooke, Carole",eng,"This paper presents a new framework for the evaluation of organizational choice primarily within the context of process redesign issues and the information technology support of those ideas. Through a process of scenario generation, the framework is designed to identify and evaluate choices in work organization and to make more explicit the implications that such choices might have for people and work roles. A central aim is to encourage the participation of different organizational stakeholders in the evaluation process. Process redesign has hitherto tended to be explored predominantly through software engineering and functionally driven approaches. The framework presented here offers a counterbalance to those works by offering an organizational perspective. It is based on a broad, scenario-generating technique which is firmly rooted in the organizational vision of a broad range of interest groups. Some work has already been undertaken in this field. Previous research has demonstrated the value of taking a broader organizational approach to workplace technology redesign and shown that the involvement of a wide range of stakeholders during evaluation can result in some very creative, practical and productive solutions. Nevertheless, this paper identifies some potential weaknesses in that previous body of research and proposes a new approach. The author draws upon earlier work in order to develop a framework which will provide more guidance to stakeholders during the scenario-generating process and which will make even more explicit the values and assumptions underlying alternative choices. The framework enables an evaluation of those technological choices at a fairly deep level, whilst remaining relatively simple to apply. The new approach presented in this paper is currently being adopted by an EPSRC-funded research team exploring issues of the relationship between business processes and legacy systems (for details of the project, please see web site: www.dur.ac.uk/CSM/SABA ). Future work will concentrate on producing further, industry-based case studies of its application and assessing its value when applied alongside traditional and technically focused software engineering methods of technological evaluation and development.",17--28,1,15,2000,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839620001500103,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839620001500103,,,2138

54,000165,Generative Innovation: A Comparison of Lightweight and Heavyweight IT,"Bygstad, Bendik",eng,"This paper proposes a simple terminology for understanding and dealing with two current phenomena; we suggest calling them heavyweight and lightweight IT. Heavy-weight IT denotes the well-established knowledge regime of large systems, developing ever more sophisticated solutions through advanced integration. Lightweight IT is suggested as a term for the new knowledge regime of mobile apps, sensors and bring-your-own-device, also called consumerisation and Internet-of-Things. The key aspect of lightweight IT is not only the cheaper and more available technology compared with heavyweight IT, but the fact that its deployment is frequently done by users or vendors, bypassing the IT departments. Our theoretical lens is generativity, the idea that complex phenomena arise from interactions among basic elements. In the context of IT, generativity helps to explain the creative potential of flexible digital technology for knowledgeable professionals and users. The research questions are: how is generativity different in heavyweight and lightweight IT, and what is the generative relationship between heavyweight and lightweight IT? These questions were investigated through a study of four cases in the health sector. Our findings show that (i) generativity enfolds differently in heavyweight and lightweight IT and (ii) generativity in digital infrastructures is supported by the interaction of loosely coupled heavyweight and lightweight IT.

56,001873,The Four P's Revisited: Business Value Assessment of the Infrastructure Impact of it Investments,"Renkema, Theo J.W.",eng,"Assessing the business impacts of increased IT investment has become one of the major issues in contemporary management. Many senior managers realize that a well-structured appraisal process might make the vital difference between IT success and IT failure, both in the private and the public sectors. Senior management's prime concern has shifted from controlling IT costs to managing and delivering IT benefits. Today, increased emphasis is being put on the role of infrastructure investments in order to fully exploit the profit potential of IT. The infrastructure impact of IT investments more and more centres around the emerging notion of an information infrastructure. Assessing the role and impacts of infrastructure investments, however, has proved to be particularly difficult and it is not yet clear how the underlying strategic decision-making process should be managed. The purpose of this paper is to present a model that offers four control options – paraphrasing conventional business wisdom in marketing coined the ‘P4 model’ – to manage investment appraisal and to support organizational decision-making. As a prelude to this, the paper explores the role of an information infrastructure from an IT investment perspective and examines four styles of decision-making. It also presents case study material from the financial services sector, in order to illustrate the relevance and applicability of the P4 model. Much of this paper draws on a research study funded by Eindhoven University and two large financial services organizations.",181--190,3,13,1998,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629801300304,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629801300304,,,1872

It acknowledges concern about the representatives of case studies but by specifying the relationships between epistemology and research methods shows that this concern is misplaced. Representatives is irrelevant for many research purposes, particularly when the distinction is made between logical and statistical inference. The validity of explanations or theory derived from case studies depends on the logic of the analysis and acknowledgement of ceteris paribus conditions, not on how typical the cases may be. Typologies of case studies have been proposed and these are considered, together with recommendations for the conduct of systematic and rigorous case study research. It is stressed that research problems should be addressed using appropriate research methods. Research of the important problems within the management area frequently demands a qualitative research approach, though it would seem that such an approach is often ignored because of a positivist research orientation. An assessment of the strengths and weakness of the case study method, which highlights its potential in the vital role of theory-building, leads to the conclusions that this method has much to commend it to information management researchers (1).",123--133,3,5,1990,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629000500302,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629000500302,,,2226

This care is provided by family doctors, known as general practitioners (GPs). The sector has been transformed in the years since 1986 by a series of legislative changes. These changes have had profound implications for the information requirements of GPs. They have led to the widespread adoption of computerized patient record systems by GPs rising from less than 25% before 1988, to greater than 75% by 1993. The paper considers evidence from a variety of historical surveys and combines this with first-hand experience drawn from working to implement information technology (IT) in the National Health Service (NHS) and through a set of interviews carried out for this study. It seeks to evaluate the process up to the present and to identify critical factors relevant to both practitioners and IT professionals who are increasingly involved with the NHS in the UK.

There has been much research to investigate organizational factors, individual differences, user involvement and their relationship to MIS success, and in particular, one indicator of MIS success, user information satisfaction (UIS). Little attention, however, has been paid to whether UIS for any particular MIS varies for users from different organization functions and different management levels within an organization. This paper reports the results of a field study of MIS in different organizations in Australia which investigates the relationship between type of user, user involvement and user information satisfaction. The results show that MIS success (UIS) varies between users of the same MIS based on their organizational function and that user involvement in the systems development life cycle (SDLC) has a significant positive effect on UIS. The significance of the effect of user involvement varies for users based on their organizational function. Technical users are less satisfied with MIS than administrative users. The relationship between user involvement and user control of the systems development process and UIS is significantly different for administrative and technical users.",160--168,3,7,1992,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629200700305,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629200700305,,,2119
66,000662,Infosys Technologies: Improving Organizational Knowledge Flows,"Mehta, Nikhil and Oswald, Sharon and Mehta, Anju",eng,"Knowledge is being discussed as one of the most important organizational resources. But these resources exist in specialized pockets dispersed across the organization, and dedicated knowledge management (KM) programs are required to improve their flow. However, high failure rates of such programs raise serious doubts about their ability to improve knowledge flows. This case traces the KM program of Infosys Technologies, Ltd – a Global Most Admired Knowledge Enterprise. The case describes how, in 1999, Infosys’ top management detected a severe lack of organizational knowledge flows while implementing a program aimed at continuously improving their core business processes. A more detailed examination exposed that the lack of knowledge flows stifled the effectiveness of their organizational structure and their business model. Alarmed by these critical findings, Infosys initiated their KM program. A five-stage knowledge maturity model (KMM) was conceptualized to aid KM implementation. With people, processes, and technology as the three pillars of Infosys’ KM program, KMM identified specific capabilities Infosys needed to develop in each of the five levels. Things worked fine till 2004 when Infosys began moving towards KMM Level 4, which required developing clear metrics to measure KM effectiveness, that is, improvements in knowledge flow. In the absence of such metrics, Infosys’ Board of Directors started questioning company's financial investment in the KM program. The CEO, who championed the KM program, knew that he faced two key challenges – to convince the Board of future revenue prospects of the KM program, and to identify metrics for assessing improvements in organizational knowledge flows.",456--464,4,22,2007,Journal of Information Technology,10.1057/PALGRAVE.JIT.2000115,article,,24,,661

The paper highlights a number of areas for consideration that arise when studying coordination within an organizational setting. The focus of the analysis is on two types of tasks: decision-making tasks and routine office processes. The paper argues that a number of (conflicting) options exist when developing the coordination aspects of group systems; they are classified across the following axes: specification and implementation of coordination; use of synchronous and asynchronous working phases; information exchange and information sharing; support of sequential and concurrent processing; support of negotiation and conflict resolution; support of analytical modelling; and description of the organizational environment.",139--150,3,8,1993,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629300800303,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629300800303,,,1986

93,001947,Evaluating Investments in IT,"Farbey, Barbara and Land, Frank and Targett, David",eng,Evaluating the costs and benefits of IT projects is currently a major issue for senior general managers. This paper focuses on a particular aspect of the problem: how organizations appraise IT investments in taking the decision whether to go ahead with them or not. The paper looks first at the different roles of evaluation; second at what is done in practice and third at what might be done given the wide range of techniques that are available and the widely different circumstances in which appraisal is undertaken. A speculative heuristic is proposed for matching an evaluation method with a particular situation. The method is presented in the hope of stimulating further research into the matching problem.,109--122,2,7,1992,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629200700207,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629200700207,,,1946

The study is balanced between a research enquiry and the consulting process with the client being the trade association. Following initial case study investigations, a postal questionnaire survey was undertaken of member organizations and individuals within them.

IIs are recursively composed of other infrastructures, platforms, applications and IT capabilities and controlled by emergent, distributed and episodic forms of control. II's evolutionary dynamics are nonlinear, path dependent and influenced by network effects and unbounded user and designer learning. The proposed theory tackles tensions between two design problems related to the II design: (1) the bootstrap problem: IIs need to meet directly early users’ needs in order to be initiated; and (2) the adaptability problem: local designs need to recognize II's unbounded scale and functional uncertainty. We draw upon Complex Adaptive Systems theory to derive II design rules that address the bootstrap problem by generating early growth through simplicity and usefulness, and the adaptability problem by promoting modular and generative designs. We illustrate these principles by analyzing the history of Internet exegesis.",1--19,1,25,2010,Journal of Information Technology,10.1057/JIT.2009.19,article,,322,,385

After completion of the project an evaluation may show that many of the problems encountered during the project could have been foreseen before they actually occurred. Risk management is an approach that is aimed at predicting the occurrence of this type of problem and at taking counter measures to either prevent them from affecting the project or to soften their impact. In this paper the basic activities related to risk management are described. Furthermore a concrete method aimed at supporting risk management is presented. This method has been used successfully in practice. Some of the results obtained by using it are presented on the basis of five cases. Some conclusions are that: (1) the use of a short and structured checklist will ease identification of and discussions about risks, (2) a risk management method in which explicit use is made of a group related approach, involving all parties, will increase reliability and acceptance of the results, and (3) involvement of a neutral process risk advisor will further both the successful use of the method and the acceptance of the results.",333--346,4,11,1996,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629601100407,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629601100407,,,2034

116,001970,A Human Resource Approach to Information Systems Development – the ISU (Information Systems Use) Design Model,"Hales, Mike",eng,"The ISU design model is an ‘architecture’ designed to support a human resource approach to information systems development. The model emerged in a live project for a large local government client, and its particular shape derives from four major areas of concern: (1) quality, and the strategic management of resources; (2) client-led management of information systems development; (3) IT-related labour market issues and equalization of employment opportunities; and (4) human-centred approaches to the design of technology systems. This article develops a working definition of human-centred design practice, indicates key practices in implementing the architecture, and identifies key concepts in interpreting the ‘feel’ of the approach. As a human-centred model, it is essentially about learning, and the article refers to three concepts of organizational learning which informed the design work.",140--161,3-4,6,1991,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/0268396291006003-405,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0268396291006003-405,,,1969

117,002370,Information Systems Planning and Alignment: A Progress Assessment,"Jackson, Ivan F.",eng,"This paper examines the ways in which to conduct planning for information services (IS) so that both computing and business problems may be addressed in an integrated fashion. It traces the evolution of IS planning from a more reactive mode, with a steering committee deciding on future directions, to a value-added approach where incremental components of a total IS product are offered to user managers for consideration. This helps overcome problems with the strategic planning process itself which is both incremental and cyclical. The organisation often focuses on a direction, only to change as the economic environment or market conditions change. The IS function consequently must move away from plans set in concrete in spite of implementation difficulties associated with that approach. The problem is one of aligning the IS plan with an often mobile corporate plan. In order to respond to this situation, there has been a move towards a marketing of IS services, so organisations can avail themselves of IS opportunities that are within the capabilities of the IS function to deliver.",216--229,4,4,1989,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839628900400405,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839628900400405,,,2369

Typical reporting systems are unable to cope with a mixture of short term control information and broad strategic information, as well as information generated from external sources. The move to a distributed environment has led to a need for the management of information flows, and specifically with the management of integrated data, often directed at the very top levels of management. There has been a recognition of the need for a formal information management programme and in response to this a new type of information professional is emerging - one trained specifically in the management of information as a corporate resource. This person may well have different skills from a systems analyst, possibly more oriented towards improving the efficiency of operational procedures. The information management profession must understand the technology, especially in the communications area, must be able to sell to and educate at various management levels and be able to formulate and implement a plan for increasing the effectiveness of the use of the information resource.",136--144,3,4,1989,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839628900400303,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839628900400303,,,2265

These issues are specifically addressed by so-called systematic literature reviews (SLRs) that propose a strict protocol for the search and appraisal of literature.

These are significant and consequential claims that – despite increasing adoption of SLRs – remained largely unnoticed in the information systems (IS) literature. The objective of this debate is to draw attention of the IS community to SLR's claims, to question their justification and reveal potential risks of their adoption. This is achieved by first examining the origins of SLR and the prescribed SLR process and then by critically assessing their claims and implications. In this debate, we show that SLRs are applicable and useful for a very specific kind of literature review, a meta study that identifies and summarizes evidence from earlier research. We also demonstrate that the claims that SLRs provide superior quality are not justified.

Although researchers and practitioners in this area have many interests in common, there is a great deal of diversity in definitions of and approaches to CSCW. This diversity has arisen despite the clarity of intention of the early seminal papers that attempted to set the agenda for CSCW research. Ten years into the development of this research area, a number of tensions appear to be diluting this initial clarity. These tensions reveal themselves in apparent disjunctions between theoretical papers and statements of intent on the one hand and CSCW practice (research and design) on the other. In this paper a review of the state-of-the-art of CSCW is offered. Some existing systems, and related design and evaluation research, are described.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the related issues in decision support and to develop an expert decision support system (EDSS) for combining decision support systems and expert systems into a unified whole for decision support. The emphasis will be on developing a DSS/ES model which can be used to integrate the traditional DSS database and ES knowledge-base for building a user-friendly EDSS.",85--94,2,3,1988,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839628800300204,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839628800300204,,,2267

The advantages offered by the Internet have determined many companies to adopt different models of Internet-enabled distribution strategy. The choice and the implementation of these strategies will be influenced, as in the case of any other marketing channel, by the characteristics of the company, of its clients, and of the traded products. On the basis of an empirical study of 500 Internet commercial sites, the present paper identifies the models of Internet-enabled distribution strategy implemented by the Web-active companies, and then verifies four hypotheses related to the factors that influence the choice and implementation of a particular strategy.",333--346,4,14,1999,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629901400403,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629901400403,,,1883

The primary focus of the research is a field study based on a questionnaire issued to the process workers who would be most affected by the changes. Management was initially concerned that resistance to change could pose a significant problem. In this respect there was particular concern that the age and background profile of the workforce could exacerbate any underlying tendency to change resistance. This paper evaluates the background to these concerns and illustrates how this particular organization dealt with them. The questionnaire results indicated a very low level of initial familiarity with any form of computer based technology. Nonetheless the results indicated a very positive response to the IT implementation proposals with virtually no evidence of attitudinal rigidity. In this sense, the results broadly support many of the observations revealed in the literature.",39--50,1,9,1994,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629400900105,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629400900105,,,2014

The theory distinguishes between four types of services computational, adaptive, networking, and collaborative services, and it suggests that organizational actors need portfolios of information services that are suited to the equivocality and uncertainty profile of the information processing they face.

This paper describes the objectives of a distributed model management system and discusses several important issues that must be considered before constructing the distributed model base. In addition, a layered schema architecture is suggested for designing the DMMS. The proposed architecture facilitates sharing, control, consistency and integration of models, without altering the current model representation schemes.

154,002249,Deconstruction Contexts in Interpreting Methodology,"Watson, Heather and Wood-Harper, Trevor",eng,"This paper considers how a methodology's theory and practice shapes contexts for interpretation. With these two terms as starting points, we also address a paradoxical situation: any description of interpreting contexts is bound to leave something out. To address this, we propose deconstruction as a double strategy for critically interpreting contexts in each situation. This relies on terms of existing oppositions in conceptual frameworks but seeks to displace the limitations they impose on how we conduct inquiry. Since meaning is context-bound but contexts are boundless, we argue that inquiry should be conducted through critical perspectives, and we describe this in terms of a systems analyst's expertise in conceptual triangulation: the defining of an unknown point in relation to two known extremes.",59--70,1,11,1996,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629601100106,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629601100106,,,2248

This study investigates the diffusion of IP telephony in Denmark by focusing on vendors’ commercialisation strategies. The theory of disruptive innovation is introduced to investigate vendors’ perceptions about IP telephony and explore their strategies that affect the diffusion process in the residential market. The analysis is based on interview data collected from the key market players. The study's findings suggest that IP telephony is treated as a sustaining innovation that goes beyond the typical voice transmission and enables provision of advanced services such as video telephony.,25--34,1,24,2009,Journal of Information Technology,10.1057/JIT.2008.29,article,,4,,213

172,002451,"Organizational Politics, Strategic Change and the Evaluation of CAD","Harris, Martin",eng,"This paper uses a ‘case in sector’ analysis to investigate the extent to which the success criteria imposed by cost accounting constrains the ability of engineers to acquire and make effective use of computer aided design (CAD). The paper examines two periods of CAD investment in a sample of UK manufacturers. In the first ‘early adoption’ period CAD proposals were made by junior engineers on a locally initiated ‘bottom up’ basis. Proposals were made according to the dictates of conventional cost benefit analysis, engineering and accounting priorities were separate, and senior management were not involved. In the second ‘general adoption’ period there was a general uptake of CAD throughout the sector. The paper demonstrates that the evaluation of CAD was influenced not just by the rival claims of accountants and engineers, but also by long run changes in the operating environment, and by the control devices employed by senior management. The findings bear out the view of technological change as a socially negotiated process. However, it would appear that the oranizational practices associated with CAD evaluation are continually re-negotiated in the light of dynamic organizational interests and changes in the broader sectoral context.",51--58,1,11,1996,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629601100105,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629601100105,,,2450
173,000555,User Personality and Resistance to Mandatory Information Systems in Organizations: A Theoretical Model and Empirical Test of Dispositional Resistance to Change,"Laumer, Sven and Maier, Christian and Eckhardt, Andreas and Weitzel, Tim",eng,"This research is driven by the assumption made in several user resistance studies that employees are generally resistant to change. It investigates the extent to which employees' resistance to IT-induced change is caused by individuals' predisposition to resist change.

The manner in which organizational change develops and the theoretical justification for the suitability of the management accounting domain for expert systems developments are reviewed, and a number of hypotheses are considered before describing and reporting the results of a survey into the attitudes and environment of UK practising management accountants. The findings suggest that management accountants may lack both awareness of the term and understanding of the nature of expert systems and that they generally do not believe that software can be trusted to make their job easier and improve the consistency of their decision making.

176,002448,Linking Strategic Information Systems Concepts to Practice: Systems Integration at the Portfolio Level,"Hamilton, Doug",eng,"Surveys during the past two decades have consistently shown that many of the most critical management concerns with information systems arise at the portfolio, rather than application, level. Architecture-driven planning with a view to the implementation of integrated information systems structures has been widely canvassed as a means of dealing with portfolio-level issues, particularly the problems of inconsistent data and uncoordinated processes which have affected many organizations in recent years. The benefits anticipated from this type of initiative have been such that many organizations have persisted with architecture-based strategies despite reports of high failure rates. This paper reports on some research into IS integration planning in the organization Telstra (formerly Telecom Australia)) during a period of 40 years. The research was conducted as an interpretive case study, with practitioners’ assessments and perspectives on IS planning being incorporated in the data analysis. The focus of the study was on four critical assumptions, which were identified during an initial review of the theoretical literature as having to hold true for an organization to expect success with this form of planning. The study revealed that none of these assumptions held reliably throughout the period studied, a point fundamental to understanding why relatively little progress was made towards published integration targets. The paper then canvasses the view that though traditionally understood as blueprints for implementation, information systems architectures could be reconceptualized as knowledge assets, with independent value as sources of core planning concepts. The conclusion drawn is that their use in this type of role could facilitate the achievement of many, if not all, of the benefits anticipated from more comprehensive approaches.",69--82,1,14,1999,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629901400106,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629901400106,,,2447

These are identified and categorized in this paper and the results of an empirical study which examined the relevance of these factors in practice are presented. The findings of the study question the relevance and validity of some of the factors that have been identified – most notably that EIS are being introduced at the request of executives who are becoming increasingly computer literate and see EIS as a means of coping with today's extremely competitive business environment. The study findings suggest that IS department push and EIS envy are factors which play a significant role in the emergence of EIS in organizations.,288--296,4,9,1994,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629400900405,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629400900405,,,2186

190,002072,How Chief Executive Officers in Large Organizations View the Management of their Information Systems,"Pervan, Graham",eng,"As part of a research programme on key information systems (IS) management issues, a survey of Australasia's largest organizations was conducted to identify which issues were perceived by their chief executive officers (CEOs) as being important, problematic and critical over the next 3–5 years. The results reported are based on a moderate response rate (though perhaps reasonable for the target group) but formal testing showed an absence of non-response bias. The most critical issues were revealed to be a mix of technology management issues (managing and measuring the effectiveness of the information technology (IT) infrastructure, and disaster recovery), strategic management issues (business process redesign, competitive advantage, and information architecture), people and support management issues (organizational learning, and executive and decision support) and systems development and data management issues (effective use of the data resource and effectiveness of software development). This reflects their interest in a wide range of issues, but all with an organization-wide focus. The non-critical issues were mostly related to the individual technologies and the place and role of IS in the organization. While the CEOs showed some agreement with their chief information officers (CIOs) on issues such as the IT infrastructure, competitive advantage and organizational learning, some distinct differences exist, particularly in relation to the quality and effectiveness of systems and processes and also how CEOs and CIOs perceive the IT knowledge of the CEOs.",95--109,2,13,1998,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629801300203,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629801300203,,,2071

This approach differs from previous research which has concentrated on learning from frauds which have occurred. The main enquiry was by means of a questionnaire sent to members of the Institute of Internal Auditors. Verification and additional information was forthcoming by visiting some respondents. Almost a fifth of internal audit departments reported that they had no specific responsibility for either prevention or detection of computer fraud. It was clear that where responsibility was acknowledged, it is generally on an informal basis or is self imposed. Internal auditors reported that most reliance was placed on computer assisted tools and manual techniques like input/output reconciliation for detection of computer fraud. Few of the organisations surveyed had any laid down guidelines what to do in the case of a fraud discovery. Where guidelines did exist they called for dismissal and prosecution. In smaller firms, external auditors have a larger role in the prevention and detection of computer fraud than in larger firms. Opinion on the prevention and detection of computer fraud included the view that as network systems become more common, so detection and prevention will become more difficult. In addition it was claimed that management did not appreciate the level of the threat. Internal auditors feel that they have a role to play, but highlighted the fact that there is a shortage of staff with the requisite skills.",230--238,4,4,1989,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839628900400406,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839628900400406,,,2473

The paper presents a preliminary theoretical justification for the emergence of offshore intermediaries, describes how and why they develop boundary spanning capabilities, and offers a case study as initial evidence substantiating the function and processes in intermediating transnational offshoring relationships. Our theory development concludes with propositions concerning four major offshore intermediary capabilities: (i) intermediating cultural distance, (ii) intermediating cognitive distance, (iii) pre-contractual preparation and negotiation, and (iv) post-contractual operational management.",18--30,1,23,2008,Journal of Information Technology,10.1057/PALGRAVE.JIT.2000124,article,,,,1693

However, even when organizations identify the need for the use of such methodologies, it is not always obvious which to use, or whether a blended combination might be appropriate. Further, in using either stand-alone or blended information systems development methodologies in practice, a number of difficulties are encountered. This paper discusses the use of an information systems development methodology which consisted of a blend of other methodologies in a real-world situation (a large telecommunications company) where no formal methodology had been used previously. A number of difficulties arose in practice, some of which were not anticipated. Examples are given of the types of difficulty encountered, and these fell into three broad categories: those related to the deficiencies in the design techniques and tools themselves; those related to implementing the system from the design; and those related to the particular environment.",127--140,3,7,1992,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629200700302,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629200700302,,,2413

The purpose of the project was to design appropriate organizational structures and functions and an accompanying information system (IS), to increase the effectiveness of the existing service. A participative sociotechnical approach was adopted for the entire design process which was carried out by the practitioners themselves. The staff's views were elicited during informal participatory group sessions as well as in one-to-one informal discussions. While ETHICS was the overall guiding methodology for the design, QUICKethics was used as a complementary means of analysing the requirements of the new IS. This paper describes the methodology used and the design process; it reflects on the adaptation and its match with the ETHICS methodology, exploring the claimed association with the viable systems methodology and concludes with suggestions for further research.",39--51,1,15,2000,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839620001500105,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839620001500105,,,2332

When crisis strikes, fast-response management depends on quickly configuring and deploying information and communications. This paper brings together research and practice in crisis response management, information technology and news media fast-response methods to derive principles for using information technology as an organizational resource. Firms increasingly recognize the need to view their information technology (IT) platform as a key business resource for just-in-time scheduling, distribution, coordination, service and logistics. If they see it as an equally key resource for just-in-time crisis response, it then creates a powerful base for crisis response management. Exxon Valdez and the Gulf War illustrate these requirements. They provide a stage model of crisis response. The model is not intended as a general description of crisis, but as a more specific modelling of organizational response capability. This stage model is illustrated by Dow Coming's recent silicon-gel implant crisis.",13--26,1,11,1996,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629601100102,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629601100102,,,1889

During the past decade this growing competition has brought with it the associated threat of survival of so many enterprises at a time when we are also experiencing the effects of a new industrial revolution created by the continuing and rapid advancements in information technology. In this paper we present the argument that the key to corporate success is associated with the development of the effective management of IT. The expenditures involved are now so large that they must be the concern of the Chief Executive Officer of the company. But, as we demonstrate, this is not the current situation in many organizations. The challenge of the ‘90s will be to integrate in an effective manner, the corporate business strategy with the increasing use of IT. In many cases, it will require a new style of management, but for those organizations who do not make this change, their corporate prosperity may be at stake.

246,002166,Challenging the Hierarchical Perspective on Information Systems: Implications from External Information Analysis,"Finnegan, Pat and Murphy, Ciaran and O'Riordan, John",eng,"The strategic choices of organizations have traditionally been influenced by their environmental interactions. Consequently, the field of information systems has become increasingly concerned with providing managers with external information. However, such systems are largely based on research that was conducted prior to the important organizational and environmental changes of the late 1980s and 1990s. Much of this research focuses on hierarchical differentiation when providing information (especially external information) to managers. This paper presents the findings of a study that investigated the sourcing, dissemination and use of external information in organizations. The results show that managerial demand for such information is unrelated to managerial level, but is influenced by functional affiliation. The study also contradicts many of the previously held beliefs about managerial preferences for information channels and media. These findings have important implications for the field of information systems, especially personnel involved in systems design.",23--37,1,14,1999,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629901400103,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629901400103,,,2165
247,000075,Cross-Cultural (mis)Communication in IS Offshoring: Understanding through Conversation Analysis,"Avison, David and Banks, Peter",eng,"The offshoring of information systems (IS) work has seen phenomenal growth in the past 5 or more years. This has resulted in IS professionals, interacting with workers from vastly different cultural backgrounds, in order to deliver IS project and support services. This cultural ‘barrier’ has been highlighted in the IS literature as a key challenge for offshoring; however, the attention given to research in the field has in the main been restricted to surveys or interviews, often reliant on reductionist national culture models. Within the fields of linguistics and anthropology, the ethnographic research technique of conversation analysis (CA) has been successfully applied to cross-cultural communications. However, there have been no concerted research efforts to apply CA to IS research in general and to IS offshoring in particular. Our research aims to address that gap by analysing naturally occurring recordings of telephone conferences between offshore vendor staff in India and UK/US employees of a major pharmaceutical company. The research has identified and analysed two important phenomena observed within these communications. Firstly, evidence of asymmetries of participation across cultural divides has been documented, and analysed for underlying causes, such as different attitudes to hierarchy and a lack of shared understanding of expected responses.

247,001137,Cross-Cultural (mis)Communication in IS Offshoring: Understanding through Conversation Analysis,"Avison, David and Banks, Peter",eng,"The offshoring of information systems (IS) work has seen phenomenal growth in the past 5 or more years. This has resulted in IS professionals, interacting with workers from vastly different cultural backgrounds, in order to deliver IS project and support services. This cultural ‘barrier’ has been highlighted in the IS literature as a key challenge for offshoring; however, the attention given to research in the field has in the main been restricted to surveys or interviews, often reliant on reductionist national culture models. Within the fields of linguistics and anthropology, the ethnographic research technique of conversation analysis (CA) has been successfully applied to cross-cultural communications. However, there have been no concerted research efforts to apply CA to IS research in general and to IS offshoring in particular. Our research aims to address that gap by analysing naturally occurring recordings of telephone conferences between offshore vendor staff in India and UK/US employees of a major pharmaceutical company. The research has identified and analysed two important phenomena observed within these communications. Firstly, evidence of asymmetries of participation across cultural divides has been documented, and analysed for underlying causes, such as different attitudes to hierarchy and a lack of shared understanding of expected responses. Secondly, differences in the rhetorical organisation of conversation by participants have also been observed and clearly documented within transcribed specimens of these conversations. These phenomena led to seven findings that are aimed to stimulate further research. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this paper demonstrates how the methodological approach of CA can be applied to IS offshoring research, producing key insights into culturally loaded conversations with clear applications for practice.

We describe two case studies as illustrations of these points and argue that the reasons for this technology-led approach lie in a complex interacting set of social systems that work effectively to marginalize the human and organizational aspects of the new technologies. The applicability of these findings to the domain of Computer Supported Collaborative Working (CSCW) is examined.

261,000628,Institutionalizing Enterprise Resource Planning in the Saudi Steel Industry: A Punctuated Socio-Technical Analysis,"Lyytinen, Kalle and Newman, Mike and Al-Muharfi, Abdul-Rahman A",eng,"In this article, we analyze institutionalization as a process of transferring and stabilizing material artifacts and routines in the form of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. Although past studies have analyzed institutionalization as structuring around scripts or discourse moves, we emphasize the material role of artifacts and routines as carriers of institutional logics. In addition, insitutionalization is not linear and incremental, but goes through sudden, nonlinear disruptions. To this end, we apply punctuated socio-technical information system change (PSIC) model that draws upon Gersick's model of change to identify and trace moves that are critical during the institutionalization. The model accounts for ERP institutionalization by chronicling complex interactions between socio-technical elements in the implementation system, the work system, and organizational and environmental context which together account for the institutionalization outcome. We use the model to analyze a longitudinal case covering 11 years (1993–2004) of ERP implementation processes in a large Saudi steel firm.

261,001690,Institutionalizing Enterprise Resource Planning in the Saudi Steel Industry: A Punctuated Socio-Technical Analysis,"Lyytinen, Kalle and Newman, Mike and Al-Muharfi, Abdul-Rahman A",eng,"In this article, we analyze institutionalization as a process of transferring and stabilizing material artifacts and routines in the form of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. Although past studies have analyzed institutionalization as structuring around scripts or discourse moves, we emphasize the material role of artifacts and routines as carriers of institutional logics. In addition, insitutionalization is not linear and incremental, but goes through sudden, nonlinear disruptions. To this end, we apply punctuated socio-technical information system change (PSIC) model that draws upon Gersick's model of change to identify and trace moves that are critical during the institutionalization. The model accounts for ERP institutionalization by chronicling complex interactions between socio-technical elements in the implementation system, the work system, and organizational and environmental context which together account for the institutionalization outcome. We use the model to analyze a longitudinal case covering 11 years (1993–2004) of ERP implementation processes in a large Saudi steel firm. Our analysis shows that the proposed material and punctuated lens toward institutionalization offers rich insights how and why ERP systems become institutions and why their institutionalization is difficult and unfolds in unpredictable ways. We conclude that the normally held assumptions of successful linear and incremental adaptation to new institutional patterns logics out by ERP systems do not hold.",286--304,4,24,2009,Journal of Information Technology,10.1057/JIT.2009.14,article,,,,1689

This paper presents the findings of a study that investigated the nature and extent of group decision making and the use of group supporting technology in Irish organizations. The paper presents a model of group decision making and examines group processes and activities as well as the use of technology at each stage. The findings indicate that group decision making is a widespread phenomenon, which was found to be far more complicated than individual decision making. However, groups were found to need a great deal of control and coordination to enable members to collaborate effectively. Nevertheless, group decision making was found to receive little technological support.

282,000619,Enhancing the measurement of information technology (IT) business alignment and its influence on company performance,"Luftman, Jerry and Lyytinen, Kalle and Zvi, Tal ben",eng,"Studies for over 30 years have consistently indicated that enterprise-level Business-Information Technology (IT) alignment is a pervasive problem. While significant progress has been made to understand alignment, research on IT alignment is still plagued by several problems. First, most alignment models approach alignment as a static relationship in contrast to analyzing the scope and variance of activities through which the alignment is (or can be) attained. Second, most alignment models are not founded on strong theoretical foundations. Third, because of their static view, these models do not guide how organizations can improve alignment. This study addresses these weaknesses using a capability-based lens. It formulates and operationalizes a formative construct rooted in the theory of dynamic capabilities and defines the scope and nature of activities that contribute to alignment. The construct identifies six dimensions promoting alignment: (1) IT-Business Communications; (2) Use of Value Analytics; (3) Approaches to Collaborative Governance; (4) Nature of the affiliation/partnership; (5) Scope of IT initiatives; and (6) Development of IT Skills. The construct measures are validated in terms of their dimensionality, item pool sampling, and the nomological and predictive validity. The research uses Partial Least Squares (PLS) to statistically validate the construct using a dataset covering over 3000 global participants including nearly 400 Fortune 1000 companies. All construct dimensions contribute significantly to the level of alignment and the construct shows strong nomological and predictive validity by demonstrating a statistically significant impact on firm performance. Scholars can leverage this research to explore additional activity-based constructs of IT-business alignment.",26--46,1,32,2017,Journal of Information Technology,10.1057/JIT.2015.23,article,,86,,618

The hybrid structure is the result of a restructuring effort by a coal company in Kentucky under the directive of its parent corporation to ensure maximum resource utilization within a more streamlined organizational structure. Through an observation of the restructuring process, we are able to demonstrate how and why it is important for top-level managers to understand and make the best use of the intricate synergism between information technology and organizational structure. The strategic implications of a hybrid structure and the roles of information technology in organizational changes are explored. We argue that a hybrid structure is a viable and strategically valuable structural alternative, especially for highly diversified conglomerates that grow through mergers and acquisitions of other companies.",37--43,1,10,1995,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629501000105,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629501000105,,,2297

286,002081,Post(-)Modern Organizations: Understanding how Cscw Affects Organizations,"Blackler, Frank",eng,"The paper reviews the ways organizations are thought to be changing as a result of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW). While claims which exaggerate the impact of technological changes should not be taken seriously, within the context of current developments in world capitalism CSCW assumes particular importance raising cultural and organizational problems at least as much as economic and technological ones. The flexibility, variety and disorder associated with ‘post-modern’ organizations (i.e. organizations characteristic of the epoch after modernism) necessitate the adoption of ‘postmodern’ approaches to understanding (i.e. approaches to the theory of knowledge developed in linguistics and philosophy) which emphasise the significance of communication, interpretation, improvization, negotiation and learning processes. The suggestion is that, for the impact of CSCW to be understood, conventional theories of organization should be replaced by theories of collective activity.",129--136,2,9,1994,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629400900204,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629400900204,,,2080

This paper shows how an approach from Complexity Science, exploratory agent-based modeling (ABM), can be used to study the impact of two different modes of use of computer-mediated communication (CMC) on organizational culture (OC) and performance. The ABM includes stylized representations of (a) agents communicating with other agents to complete tasks; (b) an OC consisting of the distribution of agent traits, changing as agents communicate; (c) the effect of OC on communication effectiveness (CE), and (d) the effect of CE on task completion times, that is, performance. If CMC is used in a broad mode, that is, to contact and collaborate with many, new agents, the development of a strong OC is slowed, leading to decreased CE and poorer performance early on. If CMC is used in a local mode, repeatedly contacting the same agents, a strong OC develops rapidly, leading to increased CE and high performance early on. However, if CMC is used in a broad mode over longer time periods, a strong OC can develop over a wider set of agents, leading to an OC that is stronger than an OC which develops with local CMC use. Thus broad use of CMC results in overall CE and performance that is higher than is generated by local use of CMC.

We articulate this approach as the hierarchy-of-parts architecture and explain how it emphasizes decomposition of a design into loosely coupled parts and subsequent aggregation of these into an industrial product. To realize the scale benefits of modularity, firms successively freeze design specifications before production and therefore only allow limited windows of functionality design and redesign. This makes it difficult to take advantage of the increased speed by which digitized products can be developed and modified. To address this problem, we draw on Christopher Alexander's notion of design patterns to introduce a complementary approach to manage technological change that is resilient to digital technology. We articulate this approach as the network-of-patterns architecture and explain how it emphasizes generalization of ideas into patterns and subsequent specialization of patterns for different design purposes. In response to the increased digitization of industrial products, we demonstrate the value of complementing hierarchy-of-parts thinking with network-of-patterns thinking through a case study of infotainment architecture at an automaker. As a result, we contribute to the literature on managing products in the digital age: we highlight the properties of digital technology that increase the speed by which digitized products can be redesigned; we offer the notion of architectural frames and propose hierarchy-of-parts and network-of-patterns as frames to support innovation of digitized products; and, we outline an agenda for future research that reconsiders the work of Simon and Alexander as well as their followers to address key challenges in innovating digitized products.",27--43,1,29,2014,Journal of Information Technology,10.1057/JIT.2013.30,article,,105,,408

We tested these hypotheses on a comprehensive archival data set comprising 33,908 projects from a major vendor in the ERP software market. Our results confirm and extend previous research. Our results support the existence of two contractual regimes: effect sizes on vendor profitability are indeed much larger in FP contracts than in TM contracts. Also in line with prior research, our results suggest negative effects of project uncertainty and project size in terms of project budget on vendor profitability and positive effects of industry knowledge on vendor profitability.

297,001883,Organizational Principles of Systems Decentralization,"Bacon, C. James",eng,"A study aimed at a determination of the organizational principles involved in systems decentralization (SD). It is based on a survey of 14 American and British companies selected for their significant investments in and mature experience of decentralized systems. There were eight principles underlying the policy and practice of SD in these companies, and the inference is that these principles appear to work. That is, considering their commonality of use and the depth of experience in the companies concerned, these principles appear to be optimizing the potential gains achievable through SD, while minimizing the potential losses. The implication is that, if these organizational principles can be effectively implemented in other organizations, they may facilitate success in systems decentralization, as well as the evolution toward distributed systems. Viewed as a whole, the principles appear to complement each other, such that they may be viewed as a conceptual model, wherein each depends upon at least one other for its effectiveness.",84--93,2,5,1990,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629000500204,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629000500204,,,1882

The technology driven approach is based on the belief that information technology (IT) offers a powerful source of competitive advantage. Popularized by, and based on the work of, Michael Porter there is a corresponding emphasis on planning and the use of ‘generic’ strategies. The competency driven approach, on the other hand, holds that each company possesses unique sources of advantage, which it must exploit to derive maximum benefits. The focus is on flexibility, while no ‘recipes’ for success are offered. Given that these two approaches appear to be diametrically opposed, 16 senior management figures from leading edge companies were interviewed to determine which, if either, of the two views was more in tune with reality.

Business growth has been generated through a natural expansion of the core activities, acquisition of other companies which has often resulted in working practices of geographically separated organizations, divisions and subsidiaries maintained to preserve their successful business culture. The role of the central IT department as the most cost-effective organization to support the business led use of IT is now in question in many companies. In this paper we present the argument that the key to corporate success is associated with the effective management of IT. In many cases, this will require a new style of management with vision and commitment from the CEO. But for those organizations who do not make this change, their corporate prosperity may be at stake.

Xcert was founded in April 1996 by Andrew Csinger and Pat Richard and was headquartered in Vancouver, Canada. Xcert's solution to Internet security was a public key infrastructure (PKI). PKI is a system of digital certificates, certificate authorities (CAs) and other registration authorities that verify and authenticate the validity of each party involved in an Internet transaction. Xcert's PKI technology allows organizations of any size to issue digital certificates to their members. These organizations become their own CA and are empowered to issue digital certificates to their individual client base. This case study is about a start-up company that is in transition from a dream stage to a reality stage. One of the issues that surfaces in the case study is intraindustry competition. Despite being an early entrant into the Internet security business, Xcert faced brutal competition from companies such as Entrust, Nortel, VeriSign and Netscape. The problems facing the company include (1) finances, (2) future direction and leadership, (3) structure, experience and size and (4) marketing. This is a very rich case study with a number of interrelated issues. The case serves two teaching aims. Firstly, this case allows students to confront and discuss real-life issues facing a start-up information technology (IT) company. The students analysing the case are asked to provide alternatives and solutions to the problems by putting themselves in the positions of the founders of the company.

310,000217,Transaction Costs and Information Systems: Does IT Add Up?,"Cordelia, Antonio",eng,"Transaction cost theory has often been used to support the use of information and communication technology (ICT) to reduce imperfection in the economic system. Electronic markets and hierarchies have repeatedly been described as solutions to inefficiencies in the organisation of transactions in complex and uncertain settings. Far from criticising this assumption, this paper highlights the limits associated with this application of transaction cost theory that has been prevalent in IS research.

There are however, some serious issues of concern surrounding the success of BPR as a methodology for organizational change. This paper attempts to highlight the issues surrounding the BPR approach to change management that remain implicit within the re-engineering literature. The research presented in this paper specifically investigates BPR in practice and concentrates on the issues of power and control that underlie many of the re-engineering methodologies and how these conflict with the prerequisites of the flattened, empowered workforce that BPR envisions. The research presented here was conducted using the interpretive approach of ethnography to investigate how middle management were able to deny the technology of BPR and disable a change project. In order to maintain their hold on power in the organization they needed to revolt against the technology of re-engineering imposed on them by senior management. In using the clinical metaphor, middle management were able to create a reality around technology that portrayed it almost as a function of biological warfare, denying it being seen as a positive social tool. This paper highlights how they were able to manipulate the technology and turn its power around to reinforce their position and power in the process.",247--257,4,13,1998,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629801300404,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629801300404,,,2166

However, it does not explicitly account for how organisational actors make sense of and enact technologies in their local context. We address this limitation by exploring the potential of using institutional theory with sensemaking theory to study IS implementation in organisations. We argue that each theoretical perspective has its own explanatory power and that a combination of the two facilitates a much richer interpretation of IS implementation by linking macro- and micro-levels of analysis. To illustrate this, we report from an empirical study of the implementation of an Electronic Patient Record (EPR) system in a clinical setting. Using key constructs from the two theories, our findings address the phenomenon of implementing EPRs at three levels: the organisational field, the organisational/group, and the individual/socio-cognitive level. The study shows how a rationalised myth of an efficient EPR system has travelled from the organisational field to the hospital ward and on to individual doctors.

320,002238,Reengineering Information Sharing Behaviour in Organizations,"Barua, Anitesh and Ravindran, Suryanarayanan",eng,"Organizational restructuring focuses on making business operations more flexible and responsive to customers. This has led to team based decision authority structures and horizontal business processes. Concurrently, the management of information has been decentralized in many organizations. Horizontal processes create information interdependencies among previously independent tasks, and call for high levels of information sharing among decision units. However, the decentralization of information management raises the possibility that units controlling specific information repositories may not readily make them available in the required form to other units, leading to poor organizational payoff. Thus it is critical to create an environment which will promote effective information flows across the organization. We suggest that mechanisms involving organizational outlook, social orientation, equitable information processing capability and communication across decision units regarding information requirements can help mitigate the information sharing problem. Using stylized game-theoretic models, we show that these organizationally oriented mechanisms have a sound economic foundation. We use these results to build a managerial basis for improving information exchange.",261--272,3,11,1996,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629601100307,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629601100307,,,2237
321,000500,Cultural Influences on it use Amongst Factory Managers: A UK-Japanese Comparison,"Kambayashi, Norio and Scarbrough, Harry",eng,"This paper seeks to analyse the influence of national cultural factors on the use of information technology (IT) by managers. An analysis of the existing literature on the interplay between technology, culture and organizational context indicates that the influence of national culture needs to be carefully specified if it is to be differentiated from institutional and organizational factors. Moreover, insofar as such influence operates at all, it is subsumed within, and not exterior to, a dynamic and emergent process of interaction between technology design and organizational practices. In this light, the study presented here seeks to avoid a simplistic approach in which national culture is viewed as an exogenous force directly conditioning action, but rather posits such influence as a critical element of the wider context which enframes action. These considerations were reflected in the research design of the empirical study presented here. This involved a survey of managers in over 1400 firms across five industrial sectors in the UK and Japan. These countries were chosen because previous studies had indicated that they exhibit distinctive cultural differences in their management practices. By conducting a large-scale survey across a range of sectors, the study aimed to abstract the diffuse effect of these cultural differences from the specific impact of sectorial and organizational contingencies. In particular, questions within the survey sought to explore the extent to which managerial preferences and practices in IT use could be interpreted in terms of two key dimensions of national cultural difference. The latter were operationalized in this study as a control orientation to IT use, and an individualistic orientation to IT use, respectively. The overall analysis of the survey data suggests that the effect of national culture is significant and seems to operate across industry boundaries. Managers in Japanese factories do in fact exhibit the hypothesized stronger orientation towards a control orientation in the use of IT, while managers in British factories show a relatively stronger orientation towards individualistic use of IT at the management level.",221--236,4,16,2001,Journal of Information Technology,10.1080/02683960110100409,article,http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02683960110100409,14,,499

The effects and processes of institutionalization have traditionally focused on stability and persistence of institutions, and more recently on institutional change. This study contributes to the IS field using the lens of coercive, mimetic and normative isomorphism and change within a highly institutionalized organizational field of health care. The setting is the National Health Service in the United Kingdom, where in 2002 a major government policy was launched to introduce Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to over 50 million citizens. Using episodic interviewing techniques and content analysis of government health IT policy documents, this study provides a longitudinal analysis of the introduction of government policy to modernize health care using information technology.

329,001293,Institutional Isomorphism and Change: The National Programme for IT – 10 Years On,"Currie, Wendy L",eng,"Institutional isomorphism has been a major intellectual contribution within institutional theory for three decades. The effects and processes of institutionalization have traditionally focused on stability and persistence of institutions, and more recently on institutional change. This study contributes to the IS field using the lens of coercive, mimetic and normative isomorphism and change within a highly institutionalized organizational field of health care. The setting is the National Health Service in the United Kingdom, where in 2002 a major government policy was launched to introduce Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to over 50 million citizens. Using episodic interviewing techniques and content analysis of government health IT policy documents, this study provides a longitudinal analysis of the introduction of government policy to modernize health care using information technology. Institutional isomorphic conditions become conflicted with attempts to impose field and organizational change. As clinicians attempt to retain their professional dominance in a climate of almost continuous restructuring of health services, political initiatives to implement EHRs are met with resistance from key stakeholders, resulting in policy changes and further delayed implementation times.",236--248,3,27,2012,Journal of Information Technology,10.1057/JIT.2012.18,article,,,,1292

In addition to the substantive topic of discussion, which corresponds to the different sections of the forum (such as Developers, Games, or Politics), we classify the threads according to structural features like the maximum number of comments at any level of the network (i.e. the width) and the number of nested layers in the network (i.e. the depth).

Worldwide, the current BPO market could be as much as $279 billion and is predicted to continue growing at 25% annually. Academic researchers have been studying this market for about 15 years and have produced findings relevant to practice. The entire body of BPO research has never been reviewed, and this paper fills that gap. We filtered the total studies and reviewed 87 empirically robust BPO articles published between 1996 and 2011 in 67 journals to answer three research questions: What has the empirical academic literature found about BPO decisions and outcomes? How do BPO findings compare with Information Technology Outsourcing (ITO) empirical research? What are the gaps in knowledge to consider in future BPO research? Employing a proven method that Lacity et al. (2010) used to review the empirical ITO literature, we encapsulated this empirical literature on BPO in a way that is concise, meaningful, and helpful to researchers. We coded 43 dependent variables, 152 independent variables, and 615 relationships between independent and dependent variables. By extracting the best evidence, we developed two models of BPO: one model addresses BPO decisions and one model addresses BPO outcomes. The model of BPO decisions includes independent variables associated with motives to outsource, transaction attributes, and client firm characteristics. The model of BPO outcomes includes independent variables associated with contractual and relational governance, country characteristics, and client and supplier capabilities. Overall, BPO researchers have a broad and deep understanding of BPO. However, the field continues to evolve as clients and suppliers on every inhabited continent participate actively in the global sourcing community. There is still much research yet to be done.

Metamorphosis is less managed and controlled, whereas maturation is representative of highly precise work carried out in controlled form. Both processes work together in open-source projects and reinforce each other.

Our work contributes to a deepening in the theorisation of what it means to be an open-source project.

The case introduces the reader to the type of decision making related to an ERP adoption and implementation and provides some interesting examples of factors which may influence actual decisions and outcomes. Among other things, the case touches on the following issues: the relationship between restructuring (re-engineering) and software adoption and implementation, the choice of package software, the pros and cons of alternative implementation approaches (‘big bang’ versus ‘phased'), the selection of hardware and the value of consultants. By January 1999 Siemens Power Corporation's (SPC's) restructuring project was more than 2 years under way. To SPC's top management's great relief, the company had made major progress ever since SPC's German parent Siemens AG hired a consulting team to help SPC get back on its path towards profitability.

This investigation is based on the detailed analysis of 1,020 DSS articles published in 14 major journals from 1990 to 2003. The analysis found that DSS publication has been falling steadily since its peak in 1994 and the current publication rate is at early 1990s levels. Other findings include that personal DSS and group support systems dominate research activity and data warehousing is the least published type of DSS. The journal DSS is the major publishing outlet; US ‘Other’ journals dominate DSS publishing and there is very low exposure of DSS in European journals. Around two-thirds of DSS research is empirical, a much higher proportion than general IS research. DSS empirical research is overwhelming positivist, and is more dominated by positivism than IS research in general. Design science is a major DSS research category. The decision support focus of the sample shows a well-balanced mix of development, technology, process, and outcome studies. Almost half of DSS papers did not use judgement and decision-making reference research in the design and analysis of their projects and most cited reference works are relatively old. A major omission in DSS scholarship is the poor identification of the clients and users of the various DSS applications that are the focus of investigation. The analysis of the professional or practical contribution of DSS research shows a field that is facing a crisis of relevance. Using the history and empirical study as a foundation, a number of strategies for improving DSS research are suggested.",67--87,2,20,2005,Journal of Information Technology,10.1057/PALGRAVE.JIT.2000035,article,,256,,65
344,001128,A Critical Analysis of Decision Support Systems Research,"Arnott, David and Pervan, Graham",eng,"This paper critically analyses the nature and state of decision support systems (DSS) research. To provide context for the analysis, a history of DSS is presented which focuses on the evolution of a number of sub-groupings of research and practice: personal DSS, group support systems, negotiation support systems, intelligent DSS, knowledge management-based DSS, executive information systems/business intelligence, and data warehousing.

355,002142,A Framework for Deciding what to Outsource in Information Technology,"Cronk, Jonathan and Sharp, John",eng,"The theory and background of outsourcing are examined from a general perspective. It is concluded that the pressures to outsource activities can best be understood through two main sources: the work of organization theorists on the management of organizational complexity and the transaction economics approach of Williamson which argues the virtues of provision of many organizational services through market mechanisms rather than by internal departments. Within IT, the early motivation for outsourcing was the cost reduction one implied by the Williamson approach. However, a number of authors have argued that the complexity of managing IT outsourcing means that it is often preferable to try to improve the efficiency of internal suppliers. This suggests that there is a need to develop a framework that will enable a decision to be made about what to outsource and what to insource. A model is applied to the IT sourcing decision.",259--267,4,10,1995,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629501000406,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629501000406,,,2141

S.",eng,"This paper investigates some of the currently available optical disk storage and retrieval systems, image manipulation systems and OCR systems. Future developments are presented and an attempt at outlining a longer term trend is made. The main conclusions of the paper are as follows: 1. Optical disk systems which are currently available are costly and are accompanied by excessive software and hardware capabilities which might be beyond the needs of the straightforward document storage and retrieval application. A tailor-made system to suit a specific application might be the route to follow provided read-only and multiple access operations are required and the optical system has a definite overall performance advantage over-microform. 2. In general, the document handling times of both the scanners and the printers of optical systems present a constraint on their continued rapid operation. 3. For general applications it might be advisable to wait for at least a year or two by which time erasable disk media should be available and some degree of disk standardization will have evolved. Costs however could still be a factor at that time. 4. The office-supplies industry is not expecting optical systems to have an appreciable effect on the ‘paperless office’ before 1990. 5.

Design for Maintenance (DFM) is an approach that argues that maintenance effort should be considered during the design of information systems in addition to the usual system design considerations. This research examines how the design of links among knowledge documents in a KMS affects both their maintenance and use. We argue that providing links among knowledge documents increases the cost of maintenance because when a document changes, the documents that link to and from that document are more likely to need changes. At the same, linking knowledge documents makes it easier to locate useful knowledge and thus increases use. We examine this tension between use and maintenance using 10 years of data from a well-established KMS. Our results indicate that as the number of links among documents increases, both maintenance effort and use for these documents increase. Our analyses suggest two DFM principles for dynamic content in practice. First, knowledge coupling (i.e., linking) to documents internal to the KMS rather than sources external to the KMS better balances maintenance effort and use. Second, designing small, knowledge cohesive documents (e.g., 250-350 words) leads to the best balance between maintenance effort and use.",312--326,4,29,2014,Journal of Information Technology,10.1057/JIT.2014.5,article,,4,,261

Turkey - a developing country - has undergone a major healthcare transformation marked by the redesign of primary care delivery and the implementation of a nation-wide Electronic Health Records (EHR) system. In this research, presenting Turkey's case, we investigate the consequences of EHR implementation in developing countries. We argue that to better understand the consequences, we need to link macro-level healthcare goals with micro-level system usage behaviors that actualize the macro-level goals or alternatively result in unintended negative health outcomes. We posit that this linkage is achieved through the meso-level structures, namely the EHR and the organizational context, in which it is embedded. Hence, we examine the EHR's role in this relationship. Our findings indicate that EHR usage both enables and constrains the achievement of clinicians' professional goals in the context of primary care delivery. Moreover, goal alignment between the government agency as the designer of the system and the clinicians influence the outcomes of the EHR-enabled transformation. When the healthcare goals are aligned, the system enables the clinicians to achieve their professional goals and their system usage behaviors converge, contributing to improvements in health outcomes. Contrarily, when the goals are misaligned, the system constrains goal achievement and the clinicians show divergent usage behaviors, including goal abandonment. In turn, goal abandonment may lead to negative consequences and even adversely affect the achievement of population-level healthcare goals in the long run.",382--400,4,31,2016,Journal of Information Technology,10.1057/S41265-016-0023-5,article,,11,,321

379,002431,Relationship Marketing in Electronic Commerce Environments,"Davis, Robert and Buchanan-Oliver, Margo and Brodie, Roderick",eng,"The advent of electronic commerce is changing marketing practice. In particular the transformation of traditional intermediaries such as the retailer is occurring as a result of new computer-mediated relationships. This paper uses the setting of an interactive home-shopping supermarket to examine the changing role of the retailer in electronic commerce environments (ECEs). We build on our previous conceptual enquiry which proposed a conceptual model which posits that retailers in an ECE apply a trust-based approach to consumer marketing relationships. In this paper we provide additional literature and empirical evidence to support our proposition that the relationship between the retailer and their customers can be defined by the disconfirmation of two cognitive images of the on-line shopping experience, these being the expected virtual (service brand-created, cognitive image of experience) and actual real (service-process-created, cognitive image of experience) images. This paper develops existing conceptualizations through new, confirmatory, interorganizational case data and consumer-oriented, qualitative, empirical evidence from focus groups that supports our proposition.",319--331,4,14,1999,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629901400402,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629901400402,,,2430

The potential for providing an adaptive intelligent tutoring system depends on having a range of tutoring strategies to select from. In order to react effectively to the student's needs, an intelligent tutoring system has to be able to choose intelligently among the strategies and determine which strategy is best for an individual student at a particular moment.

The micro-economic roles of transactions, communication and information infrastructure are analysed. These are then considered in terms of IT-related policy, from the local to the international level, illustrated by property rights legislation and changes in the European economic environment.

It identifies the growing concern of managers about justifying IT investment, and the methods which they currently use in their organizations to do so. The second part discusses the challenge facing managers, at the general level and in the field of Information Management. A major challenge is for IT/IS to be viewed within the context of strategic business thinking, the principles of which are described in this section. The third part of the paper outlines the response of managers and IT professionals in this area in the 1990s. A benefit-level matrix is described which can be used as a tool for both analysis and synthesis within the business context.

While early studies of IT outsourcing were largely qualitative in nature, more recent studies have attempted to analyse the outcomes achieved in quantitative terms. This paper is consistent with the latter, but goes further by modelling the price, performance and contract characteristics that are relevant to IT outsourcing. A two-equation recursive regression model was used to analyse 48 contracts for IT support and maintenance. The results did not reveal any quantitatively significant price-performance trade-off, but did suggest that first-term contracts (i.e. the first ever contract awarded by a client for the provision of a particular IT service) were more expensive than repeat contracts. Although competitive tendering did not result in lower prices than directly negotiated contracts, it was associated with comparatively better performance. Well-defined expectations of an organization's IT requirements were also likely to lead to improved performance when the service was outsourced.",107--118,2,15,2000,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839620001500203,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839620001500203,,,2204

407,000624,Method in Action and Method in Tool: A Stakeholder Perspective,"Lundell, Björn and Lings, Brian",eng,"Tool support for information systems (IS) development can be considered from many perspectives, and it is not surprising that different stakeholders perceive such tools very differently. This can contribute on one side to poor selection processes and ineffective deployment of CASE, and on another to inappropriate tool development. In this paper, the relationship between CASE-tools and IS development methods is considered from three stakeholder perspectives: concept developer, IS developer and product developer. These perspectives, and the tensions between them, are characterised within a ‘stakeholder triangle’.

This can contribute on one side to poor selection processes and ineffective deployment of CASE, and on another to inappropriate tool development. In this paper, the relationship between CASE-tools and IS development methods is considered from three stakeholder perspectives: concept developer, IS developer and product developer. These perspectives, and the tensions between them, are characterised within a ‘stakeholder triangle’.

It aims to show why this method is superior to other well-known focusing techniques or group evaluation methods. The scenario playing business game consists of submitting to managers a sequence of reports, one after the other. Each report (called a scenario) contains randomly generated outcome values for some parameters of the business (called candidate critical success factors) which the manager deemed to be most important for the business at hand. After reviewing each report i.e. scenario, the manager has to give a value judgement about it, like ‘good’, ‘bad’ or ‘indifferent’, reflecting his perception of how the business would be doing if the report was real. A statistical method is used to evaluate these answers and deduct from them which parameters are the most important for the manager who played the given session of the game. The paper contains a short outline of the statistical evaluation (learning) algorithm used by the author and the description of a software tool that contains an implementation of this technique. Finally, the experience gained by using this tool and approach to derive critical success factors on different projects is discussed.",12--19,1,7,1992,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629200700103,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629200700103,,,2027

Similarly, organizational and social constraints and practices impact upon individual cognitive processes and the realization of these in specific tasks. Any adequate characterization of work activities therefore requires the analysis and synthesis of information from these traditionally separate sources. We argue that existing frameworks, emanating separately from the respective disciplines (cognitive, social and organizational) do not present an adequate means of studying the dynamics of collaborative activity in situ. An alternative framework, advocated in this paper, is distributed cognition.

To facilitate interorganizational e-commerce it is often necessary to share supply and demand information between supply chain partners. Based on our analysis of supply chains in several industries we identify the mechanisms (business processes) required for effective supply chain management. We also identify the information system components needed to support these mechanisms, show how the individual components can be integrated into an information infrastructure framework and identify some technologies currently available that can fit within our proposed infrastructure. We illustrate the usefulness of our framework by simulating convergent assembly (commonly associated with motor vehicle and aerospace production) supply chain performance under various information-sharing strategies supported by our proposed infrastructure. We find that inventory costs can be reduced while maintaining acceptable order fulfilment cycle times.

This article extends our understanding of the interplay of ICTs in the public sector and Institutional trust through an in-depth comparative case-study of two successful Chilean e-servlces. The article begins by developing a relational conception of institutional trust of which Institutional trustworthiness is a component of that relationship. It then analyses the two cases separately with respect to three dimensions of institutional trustworthiness: good performance, aligned incentives, and the values of fairness and distributive justice. Following this, a comparative analysis of the two cases shows that while the implementation of technology may bring anticipated efficiency, effectiveness, and transparency gains, there are fundamental limitations to improving institutional trustworthiness through technological interventions.

Where this deployment has been most successful, there is a strong case that the organization has taken an integrated approach that both builds on the organization's strengths and pays careful attention to the process of change within the organization. However, in the literature most empirical work has either studied e-business strategy and performance from the perspective of strategy content – which highlights positioning and/or unique bundles of resources – or from the perspective of strategy process – which captures human influence and e-business implementation. In this study, we integrate these two perspectives to develop a more holistic understanding of the underlying drivers of e-business performance. Further, latent class modeling techniques are used to show that the variables in our study are heavily influenced by the unobservable heterogeneity across firms. Four distinct types of firms populate our data, and the relationship between performance and its underlying determinants varies greatly between them. The implication is that a single model cannot explain the relationship between environment, structure, feasibility, managerial beliefs and performance.

IS investment is modelled as a function of an SME's strategic context as defined by its strategic focus, i.e. cost reduction versus value added and its market positioning, i.e. few versus many customers. The paper first investigates the ways in which IS may add value to organizations. It then outlines the use of IS in SMEs. This is followed by an analysis of competitiveness in small businesses. The paper develops an analytical model, which is termed the focus-dominance model, analyses case studies of 27 firms and reports that IS investment is strongly influenced by an SME's strategic context. Four cases are presented in order to illustrate the four different IS profiles identified.

There is a strategic opportunity for IT that supports the facilitation of change, the building of closer relationships with customers, and the harnessing of human talent. Yet in many organizations there is a gulf of suspicion and misunderstanding between the chief executive and board, and the IT community. There is a requirement for IT professionals, and particularly IT directors, who share the vision of the ‘network organization’, and who can work at board level to bring it about. There is a need for facilitating directors in the boardroom. More IT professionals would secure board appointments if they could demonstrate the skills and qualities needed by a company director. IT directors require directorial qualities which are distinct from those demanded of IT managers. They need a broader, and more strategic awareness and perspective. This article examines the qualities that distinguish directors, and the key issues which should feature on the IT directors agenda.

Hence, the design of conceptual models could be informed by theories about what entities exist in the world and how they are constituted. Further, a common assumption within the field of conceptual modeling is that conceptual models and information systems describe entities in the real world, outside the systems. An alternative view is provided by an ontological commitment that recognizes that the institutional world is constructed through language use and the creation of institutional facts. Such an ontological commitment implies that there is an institutional reality, which, to a great extent, is constructed using information infrastructures. Accordingly, conceptual models have not only a descriptive role but also a prescriptive one, meaning that modelers set up a framework of rules that restrict and enable people to construct institutional reality using information infrastructures. Understanding the prescriptive role of conceptual models may revive the area of conceptual modeling in the information systems research community. Reviving conceptual modeling through institutional modeling is motivated by the effect that implemented conceptual models have on information infrastructures and institutions. The purpose of this article is to propose an institutional ontology that can support the design of information infrastructures. The ontology is theoretically informed by institutional theory and a communicative perspective on information systems design, as well as being empirically based on several case studies.

These challenges have catalyzed the beginning of a transformation in care delivery, from a health-care system that focuses on disease to one that must look after patients – including individuals and communities. To provide proper treatment to those who are chronically ill, the health-care system has to support improved individuals’ health-related practices prior to the manifestation of disease; ensure that a range of practitioners can deliver quality clinical care during the onset of an illness; and facilitate patient-provider-family partnerships during post-disease wellness care. As we describe in this review, key advances in networking and information technologies – spanning patient monitoring, data visualization and decision making, robotics and computer vision for diagnosis and surgery, social networking for fostering community-based support systems, and so on – stand to drive forward these changes.

446,002443,The Responsiveness of Information Technology to Business Strategy Formulation: An Empirical Study,"Tan, Felix B.",eng,"In a study involving 88 companies., the nature of the linkages between business strategy and information technology (IT) responsiveness was explored. The results indicate that variations in IT–strategy responsiveness, measured by the extent to which IT is explicitly considered in business strategy formulation, are linked to the type of business strategy being pursued by the organization. For example, IT is more responsive to business strategy in organizations which place heavy emphasis on innovation in their product and market strategies than in those which operate in a relatively stable product/market area. This implies that organizations with an aggressive business strategy are more likely than those with a conservative business strategy to explicitly consider IT as a strategic resource in formulating business strategy. This paper suggests that the extent to which IT is used to shape business strategy differs among organizations, and that business strategy can help us understand these differences.",171--178,3,10,1995,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629501000305,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629501000305,,,2442

The insights provided by traditional disciplines to an essentially multi-disciplinary subject is essential and very healthy. However, there is a danger of proliferating many different, overlapping frameworks of information systems. There is a need to review the frameworks and suggest a way of integrating several approaches. The future research effort depends upon a consistent set of data being available and discussed. This paper reviews previous frameworks used to promote the understanding and discussion of information systems. The one-dimensional approach is rejected in favour of a three-dimensional approach built around three basic questions characterized as the three Ts. What tasks does the information system have to perform? What technology can best deliver the systems? In what timeframe are we operating? The paper concludes by suggesting an integrated taxonomy, based on the three Ts as the basis for future research and discussion.",30--36,1,7,1992,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629200700105,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629200700105,,,2232

An ERP implementation often entails transferring the business knowledge incorporated in the basic architecture of the software package into the adopting organization. This article proposes a new approach to analysing ERP implementations from a knowledge transfer perspective. It also contributes to a better understanding of competitive advantage based on process knowledge when standardized business processes are implemented by an organization. The article begins by identifying the types of knowledge transferred during an ERP implementation and the factors affecting this transfer. It then investigates how conflicts between the business knowledge transferred from the ERP package and the existing organizational knowledge are resolved. During our investigation, we used in-depth interviews, process analysis and documentation analysis in order to analyse an early implementation stage of ERP. The results indicated that the business processes which are incorporated in an ERP package are transferred into an organization along with the business rules inherent in the processes due to process automation, the limited flexibility of such packages and the cross-functional nature of an ERP package. The results also suggested that an organization's adaptive capability concerning role and responsibility redistribution, the development of new types of required knowledge and the introduction of a different knowledge structure influence an organization's ability to internalize these standardized processes into business routines that provide a competitive advantage",281--288,4,15,2000,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839620001500404,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839620001500404,,,2037

Whilst the advantages of conducting electronic transactions are generally recognized, consensus on methodologies for quantifying the benefit success associated with interorganizational systems still remain elusive. It is argued that a comparison of pre-implementation expected benefits with post-implementation realized benefits can offer a reliable way of assessing the benefit success from EDI and other information systems. In this approach, the benefit success is expressed as a function of three benefit states namely, efficiency, neutrality and deficiency depending on whether the gap between realized and expected benefits is positive, neutral or negative respectively. In order to identify the benefit state of each participating organization, initially a series of semistructured interviews was conducted with senior managers followed by the administration of a self assessment rating instrument in the form of a questionnaire. This paper will discuss the findings along with the testing of a new conceptual framework for examining the relationship between benefit success, implementation approach and implementation success.",3--21,1,14,1999,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629901400102,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629901400102,,,2377

All too often, the problem and highly complex issue of value is either simplified, ignored or assumed away. Instead the focus of much of the research to date has been on evaluation methodologies and, within this literature, there are different strands of thought which can be classified as partisan, composite and meta approaches to evaluation. Research shows that a small number of partisan techniques are used by most decision makers with a minority using a single technique and a majority using a mixture of such techniques of whom a substantial minority use a formal composite approach. It is argued that, in mapping the set of evaluation methodologies on to what is termed the investment opportunity space, that there is a limit to what can be achieved by formal rational evaluation methods. This limit becomes evident when decision makers fall back on ‘gut feel’ and other non-formal/rigorous ways of making decisions. It is suggested that an understanding of these more complex processes and decision making, in IT as elsewhere, needs tools drawn from philosophy and psychology.",231--241,3,15,2000,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839620001500305,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839620001500305,,,1905

In this paper we examine a BPR initiative at a medium-sized UK building society in order to explore whether BPR succeeded or failed and to place BPR within the wider context of an organization facing a merger. The study describes the development of a novel BPR methodology which combines both hard and soft modelling approaches and reveals a degree of success in terms of process modelling and gaining consensus on process content and faults. However, two more far-reaching initiatives served to drain away support from the BPR effort: a parallel organizational analysis undertaken by an external consultancy and the hidden (although rumoured) merger talks with a larger partner. Therefore it is inappropriate to view BPR as an isolated, strategic initiative when, in practice, it may be one of several competing change activities vying for support within a changing organizational context.

The findings suggest that, if the ASP model is to succeed, vendors will need to carefully identify customer requirements and avoid the pitfalls that beset the first wave of the ASP model, which was largely based upon a technology push strategy.",39--58,1,19,2004,Journal of Information Technology,10.1057/PALGRAVE.JIT.2000006,article,,,,1293

462,000514,What Drives the Adoption of Mobile Data Services? An Approach from a Value Perspective,"Kim, Byoungsoo and Han, Ingoo",eng,"Mobile data services (MDS) are wireless value-added pay-per-use services that have attracted increased attention in recent years. In this paper, a theoretical framework is proposed to investigate key drivers of user behavior in wireless pay-per-use services based on a value perspective. This study examines the role of three evaluation criteria -utilitarian, hedonic, and social values - in adoption decisions. Potential adopters have no direct experience with MDS; thus, they likely conceive value based primarily on indirect experience with it, such as through communication with peers or advertisements. In this study, the influence of members in the social networks and external sources are regarded as the major sources of information in order to capture the role of these factors on the perceptions of value. Additionally, according to the age and gender of potential adopters, changes in the degree to which the antecedents lead to MDS acceptance are examined. The proposed model is empirically tested using survey data collected from 287 potential adopters. The analysis results show that the proposed model, based on the aforementioned view of value, provides a significant explanation of the variance in the level of adoption intention toward MDS. The results of this study indicate that utilitarian and social values dominate adoption decisions, whereas the impact of hedonic value in MDS acceptance is weaker than other values. Information from relevant others and from mass media play a critical role in forming the perceptions of value obtained from the use of MDS. The results also shed light on the moderating effects of age and gender on MDS acceptance. Theoretical and practical implications of this work are discussed.",35--45,1,24,2009,Journal of Information Technology,10.1057/JIT.2008.28,article,,88,,513

Although comprehensively capturing organizations’ requirements considerably affects the success of an ES sourcing project, little is known about how requirements evolve beyond the implementation. We conduct a longitudinal, exploratory single-case study of the life cycle of cloud-based ES in a medium-sized organization. Over 5 years, we trace the evolution of requirements throughout the ES life cycle, beginning with the initial adoption decision and ending with considerations to retire the ES. We develop a process theory that explains how requirements evolve beyond ES implementation and throughout its life cycle. We isolate nine mechanisms that explain how contextual factors and experiences are intertwined and shape the evolution of requirements. We then develop seven propositions that explain how sourcing cloud-based ES alters the mechanisms that shape the evolution of requirements. Our findings emphasize that the evolution of requirements for cloud-based ES follows similar mechanisms to that of the requirements for on-premises ES but changes how particular mechanisms manifest. Sourcing cloud-based ES changes the influence of business divisions in acquisition and configuration activities, the role of upgrade and customization procedures, and the influence of the ES’ ecosystem.",151--170,2,33,2018,Journal of Information Technology,10.1057/S41265-016-0001-Y,article,,,,831

We propose that this is because DSS effectiveness is contingent upon a number of factors related to the task and DSS under investigation. This paper reports a longitudinal experiment designed to evaluate the relationship between DSS effectiveness and two such factors: DSS sophistication and task complexity. In comparison to unaided human judgement, two levels of DSS were evaluated: a deterministic spreadsheet model and a probabilistic model with a graphical risk analysis aid. Our subjects made decisions in a business simulation providing two successive phases of increasing task complexity. Initially, when task complexity was low, we found that neither DSS affected subjects’ performance. In the more complex phase, both types of DSS users performed significantly better than unaided subjects. However, risk analysis users performed no better than model-only users. Interestingly, DSS users performed less homogeneously than unaided subjects in the complex phase. DSS users had greater confidence and considered more alternatives than their unaided counterparts. Risk analysis users took longer making decisions in the early stages, while model-only users became the most efficient in the later stages.",19--28,1,9,1994,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629400900103,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629400900103,,,2246

480,002048,Executive Information System Failure: A New Zealand Case Study,"Bussen, Wendy and Myers, Michael D.",eng,"It is well known that executive information systems (EIS) are high risk systems to implement and maintain. Factor research is the most commonly used framework for studying the causes of EIS failure yet there is no conclusive evidence that the factors suggested in the information systems (IS) research literature ensure system success. This paper reports on a case study of a failed EIS in a large New Zealand organization and compares this case with the success factors found in the research literature. One of the findings is that the broader issues surrounding the failure were more significant than the more narrowly focused factors suggested by the factor research approach.

481,002222,A model of ERP project implementation,"Parr, Anne and Shanks, Graeme",eng,"Problems with the implementation of ERP systems are well documented. Although companies spend millions on ERP packages and the implementation process, there is extensive evidence that they experience considerable problems, particularly during the actual implementation project. This paper presents a project phase model (PPM) of ERP implementation projects that is a synthesis of existing ERP implementation process models and focuses on the implementation project. Two case studies of ERP implementation within the same organization, one unsuccessful and a later successful one, are reported and analysed in order to determine which critical success factors (CSFs) are necessary within each phase of the PPM. The CSFs are drawn from an earlier stage of this research and from recent literature. The PPM is used as a ‘lens’ for understanding ERP implementation projects, by highlighting the differences between the two cases. We then offer an explanation for these differences, focusing particularly on the successful case. Firstly, the organizational learning that occurred during the unsuccessful project and the associated early appointment of an experienced ‘champion’ with clearly defined responsibilities were critical to the successful project. Secondly, organizations implementing ERP systems should partition large projects into several smaller, simpler projects identified here as ‘vanilla’ implementations. The PPM, together with associated CSFs, provides guidance for practitioners when planning ERP implementation projects and also provides researchers with a foundation for further empirical research.",289--303,4,15,2000,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839620001500405,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839620001500405,,,2221

Examining the Information Content of Stock Microblogs on Financial Markets,"Li, Ting and van Dalen, Jan and van Rees, Pieter Jan",eng,"Scholars and practitioners alike increasingly recognize the importance of stock microblogs as they capture the market discussion and have predictive value for financial markets. This paper examines the extent to which stock microblog messages are related to financial market indicators and the mechanism leading to efficient aggregation of information. In particular, this paper investigates the information content of stock microblogs with respect to individual stocks and explores the effects of social influences on an interday and intraday basis. We collected more than 1.2 million stock-related messages (i.e., tweets) related to S&P 100 companies over a period of 7 months. Using methods from computational linguistics, we went through an elaborate process of message feature reduction, spam detection, language detection, and slang removal, which has led to an increase in classification accuracy for sentiment analysis. We analyzed the data on both a daily and a 15-min basis and found that the sentiment of messages is positively affected with contemporaneous daily abnormal stock returns and that message volume predicts 15-min follow-up returns, trading volume, and volatility. Disagreement in microblog messages positively influences stock features, both in interday and intraday analysis. Notably, if we give a greater share of voice to microblog messages depending on the social influence of microbloggers, this amplifies the relationship between bullishness and abnormal returns, market volume, and volatility. Following knowledgeable investors advice results in more power in explaining changes in market features. This offers an explanation for the efficient aggregation of information on microblogging platforms. Furthermore, we simulated a set of trading strategies using microblog features and the results suggest that it is possible to exploit market inefficiencies even when transaction costs are included. To our knowledge, this is the first study to comprehensively examine the association between the information content of stock microblogs and intraday stock market features.

The software engineering productivity figures measured by FPA in this company varied widely across the departments of the division and projects. Investigation of the reasons for the variations showed that, in addition to factors such as the technology platform and application characteristics, organizational and human factors affect the accuracy and reliability of productivity figures. Elucidating the lessons from this case, this paper suggests that three factors – knowledge of the FPA, calibration of the function point productivity indicator and rigour of the measurement process – are critical to the successful implementation of an FPA programme. These findings and the issues identified in the paper will be of interest to academics in the area of software productivity measurement and companies considering FPA as a productivity metric.",79--90,1,15,2000,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839620001500108,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839620001500108,,,1933

497,000315,Governance Configurations for Inter-Organizational Coordination: A Study of Public Safety Networks,"Fedorowicz, Jane and Sawyer, Steve and Tomasino, Arthur",eng,"We focus on networked arrangements of digital resources that are shared among otherwise independent units to advance conceptual and empirical insights about their governance. We are motivated by the simple observation that, increasingly, independent organizations are engaging in shared activities, often relying on purpose-built digital infrastructures to support this move to inter-dependence. To advance current conceptualizations of networked governance, we draw on data from 42 public safety networks and use fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis. We do so because fsQCA allows us to account for the realities of inter-dependence among the concepts and variables we consider and to illuminate the multiple viable governance patterns that are possible. The results show the importance of network-level governance competencies to manage stakeholders and information infrastructure to achieve high effectiveness of PSN.

We are motivated by the simple observation that, increasingly, independent organizations are engaging in shared activities, often relying on purpose-built digital infrastructures to support this move to inter-dependence. To advance current conceptualizations of networked governance, we draw on data from 42 public safety networks and use fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis. We do so because fsQCA allows us to account for the realities of inter-dependence among the concepts and variables we consider and to illuminate the multiple viable governance patterns that are possible. The results show the importance of network-level governance competencies to manage stakeholders and information infrastructure to achieve high effectiveness of PSN.

This paper presents the findings of a longitudinal study which examined the relationship between computer-based information systems (IS) and empowerment in detail drawing heavily on empirical work carried out in the British manufacturing industry. The paper elaborates and discusses the conceptual issues which are relevant to the idea of empowerment and its relationship with IS, before determining empowerment to be in essence the decentralization of decision-making authority to lower levels of the organization. The lack of any research on this topic led us to carry out a combination of empirical research. A large-scale postal survey of 450 UK manufacturing companies followed by a series of 20 in-depth interviews in 18 top UK manufacturing organizations formed the basis for this paper. The findings confirmed that empowerment is indeed pursued by many UK manufacturing organizations within their various efforts at improving their organization of work. The research participants viewed IS as an important enabling tool for empowerment offering many opportunities, but clearly noted that the role of IS in this is supportive rather than initiating; IS do not lead to employees becoming empowered. However, the interviews revealed that manufacturing organizations are facing a wide range of problems and difficulties with their existing IS raising a number of constraints. The paper concludes with a number of practical suggestions for using IS as a supportive means for empowering employees.",211--230,3,15,2000,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839620001500304,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839620001500304,,,2314

The tools that are used to analyse conventional innovation processes are found to be inappropriatte for software. The characteristics of software which present conceptual difficulty, and the features which drive change in the software development process are identified. Three lines of technological development in software are discussed: product diffusion, innovation in the organization and management of the development process, and innovation in technical practice. These reflect currently dominant and emergent trends, in particular the shift away from wholly custom-built towards packaged software; concern with process issues, including quality accreditation; and technical developments including CASE (computer aided software engineering) and object orientation. A framework is proposed which supports analysis of the distinctions and interactions between technical practice and organizational aspects of the development process, and also explains the interdependence between product diffusion and process innovation.",3--17,1,9,1994,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629400900102,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629400900102,,,2175

A questionnaire and interview format was used to gather information from eleven commercial organisations developing KBIS. Three prime areas were considered, namely knowledge acquisition, knowledge representation, and KBIS development methodologies. For each of these areas, the normative position as expressed in the literature is presented and then compared to the survey findings. Problems involved in the development of KBIS are mentioned as well as developers’ perceptions of the future directions for KBIS within their organisations. Additional information on each organisation is presented in an Appendix in order to provide a richer picture and background to the study. The main preliminary findings are that KBIS have made an impact on organisations in Australia who are willing to make a considerable investment of resources in this new venture. While most organisations are treating this technology as research and development, they believe that the technology will be absorbed into their mainstream information systems in the future. These systems are seen as providing a competitive edge to those organisations willing to make the investment.",145--158,3,4,1989,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839628900400304,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839628900400304,,,1943

It is argued through the cyber-ethnographic examination of two virtual communities that, interpretative research methods traditionally associated with the social sciences enforce preconceived ideas and normative frameworks on to the virtual community. Cyber-ethnography allows a reflexive methodology to emerge, thus enabling the participants of virtual communities to define their own reality and perimeters. It is propounded that there are two elements to the virtual community. First, it is emphasized that a hybrid space is rapidly emerging that is neither absolutely physical or virtual. Through its convergence with the physical the virtual community's existence is apparent, though not unconditionally virtual. Secondly, the participants are depicted as having a transitory, unconditional relationship with the virtual community. That is; they will only participate for short periods when they require use of the resources that the virtual community has to offer.",95--105,1,14,1999,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629901400108,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629901400108,,,2480

To date, the extant literature has centred on the technology acceptance model (TAM) because it is arguably one of the most widely cited and influential models used for explaining the acceptance of IT. However, this literature has remained relatively silent with respect to the role that differences in national culture might play in IT acceptance as globalization continues. In order to begin to address this deficit, this paper offers a series of research propositions that explore the potential impact of differences in national culture on IT implementation and acceptance. Specifically, the paper explores the effects of culturally induced beliefs – including individualism-collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, long-/short-term orientation and power distance – on the implementation processes that impact on key variables in the TAM. The paper then discusses the potential importance of the revisions it has made for both researchers interested in employing the model for predicting IT acceptance in cross-cultural contexts and for managers faced with introducing new IT in a global organization.",145--158,3,16,2001,Journal of Information Technology,10.1080/02683960110063654,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02683960110063654,,,936

Basically these lie between conventional information systems in which data are well defined, and management support, and decision support systems. A soft system is a system which operates on soft data. Such data cover categories of information such as conjectures, predictions, feelings and opinions and are typically found in systems where there is some element of anticipation of the future. Such systems include career counselling systems, where clients have rather ‘fuzzy’ views of what they might wish to do, through to economic based systems used to predict levels of employment, inflation levels and interest rates etc. In between are management-type systems in which it is normally assumed that hard (i.e. factual) data are used, for instance in budgeting systems.

533,002181,Financial and Strategic Motivations behind is Outsourcing,"Mclellan, Kerry and Marcolin, Barbara L. and Beamish, Paul W.",eng,"Information Systems (IS) functions and whole IS departments are being outsourced in industries where the IS functions have been considered ‘core’ to the success of that business. Why and how senior management came to make these decisions is the focus of this article. It explains the motivations behind Information Technology (IT) outsourcing when popular alliance theories, such as transaction cost theories, game theory and joint-venture alliance theory suggested firms would not outsource an entity if core competency would be lost. Seven case studies were used to investigate the IT outsourcing phenomenon in the observed ‘alliance-like’ relationships emerging in the banking industry in the early 1990s. Inductive theory generating research was undertaken in this work following Yin's (1984, 1989) guidelines of multiple case replications to ensure rigorous and systematic data collection procedures. Before the case studies were conducted, 40 preliminary interviews were undertaken with managers of companies that were and were not involved in IT outsourcing contracts to explore the theorized factors of interest drawn from the literature, to develop the propositions, and to refine a structured interview guide. These preparatory steps led into the initial case study, and the literal replications of the proposed factors to confirm the patterns found. A theoretical replication based on conflict resolution was then undertaken to expose greater variation in conflict with the outsourcing relationships to contrast the initial patterns found. The results suggest that financial motivations underlie many IT outsourcing decisions, and unresponsive IS departments are accelerating the pace of the outsourcing process. Within this research, IT outsourcing was found to have profound effects on the expenses for the banks. However, contrary to conventional wisdom, IT outsourcing is taking place within firms and industries which utilize IS activities that are considered core competencies. Several strategic motivations were presented that may explain this management decision. Firms were undertaking IT outsourcing to change the organizational boundaries, to restructure, to mitigate technological risk and uncertainty, to access emerging technology, to manage the IS department better, and to link business and IT strategy.",299--321,4,10,1995,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629501000409,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629501000409,,,2180

534,002269,An Integrated Framework for Information Systems Planning and Its Initial Application,"Lee, Gwo-Guang and Gough, Tom",eng,"This paper outlines an approach to information systems planning (ISP) that addresses not just the technical problems encountered in ISP but the whole range of problems which derive from social systems, organizational processes, formal organizational arrangements, technology and the external environment. The approach is designed to improve the effectiveness of the high-level planning processes for information systems (IS). A five-phase framework is proposed. The first phase, the perception phase, aims to provide the managers with an environment that enables them to recognize the strategic value of IS and that activates them to participate in strategy formulation. The second phase, the evaluation phase, involves the evaluation of the organization's systems. The third phase, the selection phase, is focused on analysing the data collected from previous phases in order to select feasible projects. The fourth phase, the construction phase, is responsible for producing a set of preliminary IS plans. The fifth phase, the review phase, aims to ensure that ISP effectiveness is further enhanced by ongoing adjustments to the plans. The paper includes brief comments on the initial application of the framework in the Mingchi Institute of Technology.",227--240,4,8,1993,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629300800404,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629300800404,,,2268

Structures, as evidenced by 14 case studies and the words of six financial directors, are defined here as organizational responses, including user committees and responsibility accounting, quantitative assessments of IT projects, such as financial appraisals, and qualitative assessments. Structures in practice seem to allow for a changing world in which projects are accepted according to business needs and subsequent actions lead accepted projects to be adapted and managed as time passes. In order to manage IT technology in this way, structures alone are important but not sufficient. Active individuals have an important role to play and credibility becomes an important factor in evaluation and implementation. The credibility of IT management is created by its selling of the project in the first place and then by its ability to manage the project in a responsive way. Credible strategists are at least as important as a strategy to the evaluation of IT.",131--143,2,12,1997,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629701200205,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629701200205,,,2440

543,001915,A Methodology for the Evaluation of IT for Strategic Implementation,"Elliot, Steve and Melhuish, Peter",eng,"The integration of business strategic planning and IT has been raised as one of the most important issues facing management in the 1990s. At the same time, there have been spectacular failures when business ventures have sought to exploit information technology. So how does business management go about applying information technology in order to maximize the possibility of gaining success, while minimizing the possibility of failure? Most literature concerned with information technology and evaluation focuses on the evaluation of benefits from the use of a technology. The limited amount of literature which considers the ‘front end’ of the process of selection, as well as implementation of information technology, is more concerned with identifying the business problem areas, the actions of competitors or how to set priorities between projects, than looking at the potential utility of a new or emergent technology. This paper presents a practical methodology which can be used by management to evaluate an information technology and to determine its apparent suitability for their business at this particular time. Its strength lies in the capability of IS management and line managers to quickly and cost-effectively identify the major opportunities for the application of technology to business problems.",87--100,2,10,1995,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629501000202,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629501000202,,,1914

Our central purpose In the review was to answer two research questions: What has the empirical academic literature found about information technology outsourcing (ITO) decisions and outcomes? What are the gaps In knowledge to consider In future ITO research? To answer these questions, we examined 164 empirical ITO articles published between 1992 and 2010 In 50 journals. Adapting a method used by Jeyaraj et al. (2006), we encapsulated this vast empirical literature on ITO In a way that was concise, meaningful, and helpful to researchers. We coded 36 dependent variables, 138 independent variables, and 741 relationships between Independent and dependent variables. By extracting the best evidence, we developed two models of outsourcing: one model addressed ITO decisions and one model addressed ITO outcomes. The model of ITO decisions includes Independent variables associated with motives to outsource, transaction attributes, client firm characteristics, and influence sources. The model of ITO outcomes includes Independent variables associated with client and supplier capabilities, relationship characteristics, contractual governance, decision characteristics, and transaction attributes.

Rather than adopting one perspective about the SAP project, we provide the views of different participants using their own words, arguments and ideas as much as possible. The play is constructed from summaries of systematic interviews which were changed only to suit scholarly objectives and a dramatic presentation. At the request of the company involved, the names and locations in this case have been disguised. Act 1 describes the company's vision concerning the implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, a crisis which emerged during the initial phase of implementation and the actions taken to remedy the shortfalls. Act 2 describes the project management, the dynamics between the implementation team members and the organizational implications of an ERP system implementation. The actual performance of the play and a subsequent discussion among the participants enable students to re-create and experience the thrills, frustrations, dilemmas and concerns originally expressed by the people who inspired this account of SAP implementation.

To this end, we employed a research approach based on autobiographical material. Sixteen well-known BI scholars served as informants, and provided career autobiographies in which they document their perceptions and observations regarding the genesis and development of BI. The average age of this sample of contemporary witnesses is 70 years, signifying a rich body of experience. Based on an interpretive analysis of the data, we find that the design of IS is deeply rooted in BI's history, and our results also show that there have always been close relationships with practice.

In order to solve it several questions must be answered like: what is the object of valuation; how is value defined and measured; and what constitutes a coherent and usable method for valuation.

The first is used to define the object of analysis (an information commodity) and the nature of value (the demand value at the marketplace). The third allows the modelling of business processes in terms of activities and cost relations between activities. The second enables the assignment of costs to activities modelled in the graph. Together they constitute a coherent and usable method for determining the value of IS.

567,001920,CASE Requirements for Data-Centred Business Applications,"Tate, Graham and Verner, June and Hayward, Richard",eng,"From a CASE point of view business applications can be divided into three broad classes depending on their generality: those requiring general workbenches, those requiring specifically tailored workbenches, and those that could use blueprints. A CASE environment for all seasons is not what many business users really need. They would prefer an environment tailored to the specific class of application under development, one that will bring that application into being most efficiently and effectively, and keep it in vigorous operation over its lifetime. We have therefore concentrated on one particular application class of interest to the business community, namely interactive, data-centred systems. A model for the application class of interest is presented. The main CASE environment requirements identified, which should be integrated through a common project database and tailored to the characteristics of the application class, include business profile, semantic data model, state transition control model, system dictionary active during development, inheritable and tailorable objects such as reports, transactions and other user interactions, procedural facilities, configuration control, project control including costing and scheduling, and interfaces to decision support systems.

A study of the anticipated benefits of 178 projects as seen by IS managers and analysts revealed nine benefit factors. Business redesign emerged as the most important benefit. Some benefits are much more highly quantified than others. Organizations planned to spend more on projects whose top benefit was workforce reduction. Researchers can use these findings to study why and how organizations achieve the benefits of some proposals.

Consequently, successful deployment and use of ERP systems are critical to organizational performance and survival. This paper presents the results of a study of the problems and outcomes in ERP projects which was conducted under the sponsorship of an ERP systems vendor. Two basic research questions were addressed. First, how successful are companies at different points in time in their ERP experiences and how are different measures of success related? (That is, can early success be followed by failure and vice versa?) Second, what problems do ERP adopters encounter as they implement and deploy ERP and how are these problems related to outcomes? The findings showed that the success of ERP systems depends on when it is measured and that success at one point in time may only be loosely related to success at another point in time. Companies experience problems at all phases of the ERP system life cycle and many of the problems experienced in later phases originated earlier but remained unnoticed or uncorrected. These findings suggest that researchers and companies will do well to adopt broad definitions and multiple measures of success and pay particular attention to the early identification and correction of problems.",245--265,4,15,2000,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839620001500402,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839620001500402,,,2181

584,002154,The Politics of Risk: Trials and Tribulations of the Taurus Project,"Drummond, Helga",eng,"The term ‘risk management’ implies that risk is something which can be quantified, predicted and controlled. This paper seeks to demonstrate the limits of this assumption where complex projects are involved. The argument is based upon a case study of a failed &pound;80 million IT venture known as Taurus. Analysis focuses upon the relationship between politics and the assumption of risk. Acceptance of risk, it is argued, is ultimately determined by the balance of power between decision makers. Moreover, risk analysis and other techniques of management may actually compound the difficulties by fostering an illusion of control and escalation.

585,002458,Loyalty of on-Line Bank Customers,"Methlie, Leif B. and Nysveen, Herbjørn",eng,"Electronic commerce changes the relationships between sellers and buyers dramatically. The new properties of electronic markets offer customers added values. New customer value propositions have to be established in most markets and new marketing strategies must be formulated. One of the business sectors most heavily affected is banking. How can banks retain loyal customers when moving into electronic banking? Research in marketing has unveiled several determinants of customer loyalty. However, this knowledge is based on research on customers in traditional markets. In this paper we focus on customers’ loyalty in on-line banking. The findings indicate that determinants of loyalty in on-line banking environments are similar to those in the physical market-place. However, customer satisfaction is found to have the most significant impact, followed by brand reputation, while switching costs and search costs, although significant, have minor explanatory power. The implications of these findings on banks’ marketing strategies are discussed.",375--386,4,14,1999,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629901400406,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629901400406,,,2457

This ethnographic study examines Lotus NOTES in a sub-section of the Irish civil service, with particular reference to the concurrent use of electronic and paper documents. The sub-section examines disagreements with regard to claims by Irish citizens for particular government benefits. The study describes how meta-information contained in paper case files is perceived as necessary for the work of the organization, thus restricting the use of electronic case files in NOTES as a shared information system. However, this reliance on paper files derives not only from the information rich properties of paper documents, but also from the desire of some workers to protect their occupational status by defining, as necessary for their job, information which is only available in paper documents and which only they can interpret. This dependence on paper documents also reduces the amount of information that can be shared within the organization. This paper suggests that, only if the perceived threat posed by the information system were reduced in some way would user innovations in work practices and greater sharing of information within the organization become possible.",235--246,4,13,1998,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629801300403,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629801300403,,,1868

Experience to date concerning these efforts reveals that the key determinants of successful implementation of the technology are associated with organizational factors rather than hardware and software. However, these factors have been inadequately addressed in the literature on information technology in developing countries and empirical research drawing on experience of individual projects in developing countries is needed. To this end, this paper describes the case of the Computerized Rural Information Systems Project (CRISP) which is a government initiative to promote decentralization of rural development management in India. The interaction between formal, government-approved guidelines for rural development management and informal practice at the local level is examined.

594,002473,Is Innovation and Organizational Alignment – a Professional Juggling Act,"Burn, Janice M",eng,"The securing and maintaining of alignment between business strategies and information systems (IS) strategies is frequently cited as a critical concern of IS managers. Consequently it has been ranked as an important issue for IS research agendas over the last decade. Very few empirical studies, however, have been reported with the result that there is no firm evidence to support the need for alignment, far less evidence for the way that strategies might interact. This paper reports the results of a longitudinal study which examines both IS and business strategies using an external-internal alignment model. After four years of data collection and analysis there is strong support for an alignment model which follows a lead-lag strategy. This implies that alignment is not a steady state but will reflect a dynamic model of change. In order to foster innovation in IS this change model requires to be managed through a ‘r'evolutionary cycle. This resembles a professional juggling act rather than a managed stage growth process. The alignment and change models are described and related to the management of innovation and organicity. In addition a continuing and future research agenda is identified.",3--12,1,11,1996,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629601100101,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629601100101,,,2472

To do this, we identify the different assumptions regarding the implementation context implicit in the two theories and, based on these differences, develop a contingent model within which to integrate the two theories. A partial test of the model within one particular context is reported using data collected from the end-users of an IS innovation introduced in a State health system in Australia. As hypothesized, we find that, within the context, characterized by high individual level impact and low group level impact, the contribution of innovation characteristics to implementation success is higher than that of implementation process.",53--68,1,14,1999,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629901400105,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629901400105,,,1857

Reports frequently note that ‘power’ goes to those who gain relevant trading information in marketing channels. The paper then asks whether and how structured or ‘automated’ trading information exchanges (e.g. electronic data interchange (EDI) links) between suppliers and wholesalers impact on their bargaining power in grocery marketing channels. This paper starts with the view that automated information exchanges favour the suppliers because they obtain trading information and gain marketing flexibility more than the wholesalers do. Focusing on the perspective of grocery wholesalers, the paper examines the relationships between (1) EDI use, (2) suppliers’ incentives for EDI, (3) wholesalers’ perceived bargaining power and (4) trust and cooperation between wholesalers and suppliers. Based on exploratory survey data from 33 grocery wholesalers, the paper finds that automated information exchanges may lower wholesalers’ perceived bargaining power. It also shows that an appropriate level of incentives from suppliers tends to compensate for the power loss.

This leads us to consider how critical research impacts upon actual IS praxis, in particular the role of the IS professional, systems development and changes in the nature of organizational life itself. This is not intended to be a comprehensive review of the literature. Rather by drawing upon a sample of material covering a range of perspectives it aims to give an impression of the many developments in critical studies on organization and IS and to consider their implications for future direction.",271--283,4,17,2002,Journal of Information Technology,10.1080/0268396022000017789,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/0268396022000017789,,,1205

However, like many advances in information technology, public sources, such as trade journals and newspapers, portray client/server as a completely new paradigm which will transform our profession. But is it? We are conducting multiple case studies on organizations that have adopted client/server technology in order to extract managerial prescriptions for best practices in evaluating, developing and implementing effective client/server systems. Thus far, we have completed three case studies. Many of the lessons we are uncovering – the need for top management support, redesigning business processes before automation, user participation, phased implementation strategies and buying-in vendor skills to transfer learning – have been identified by previous researchers in other information technology contexts. Thus, although client/server is being touted as a radical change in information technology, practitioners need not discard the lessons from the past. Although there are some unique technical skills required to deploy client/server systems effectively, confirming project management lessons from the past is consoling to practitioners and academics alike.

Now it has been charged with transforming itself to facilitate the company's need for greater integration, including a move to standardized systems.

637,002446,Management and the Hybridization of Expertise: Eftpos in Retrospect,"Howells, John",eng,"This paper will show how the UK banks learnt the strategic value of retaining IT expertise in-house through their experience of the design of EFTPOS networks. The banks began by attempting to ‘buy-in’ IT expertise from other organizations, but they were first compelled to locate expertise in a jointly-controlled organization called EFTPOS UK, then forced to develop the new IT expertise within their existing IT departments. These manipulations of the ‘organizational location’ of expertise gave individual banks the ability to create their own technology strategies, which they promptly exploited in an attempt to gain competitive advantage. It will be argued that a greater capacity to form individual technology strategies and exploit competitive advantage will result from the active management of two other dimensions of expertise: these are termed the internal location and the individual partition of expertise. The first term refers to where in the organization technical expertise is located and the second to how technical expertise is divided between individuals. The process by which the individual partition of expertise changes is called the hybridization of expertise and it is argued that although this is to an extent ‘natural’ it may certainly be managed. The case for a more aggressive and explicit expertise strategy, including the active management of the process of hybridization, is made by reference to the nature of the network design and practices in the management of technical expertise in other industries.",83--95,1,12,1997,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629701200107,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629701200107,,,2445

639,000634,The Role of (Personal) Network Effects and Switching Costs in Determining Mobile Users’ Choice,"Maicas, Juan Pablo and Polo, Yolanda and Sese, Francisco Javier",eng,"Network effects and switching costs are two major economic forces in information technology industries. Although the consequences of these mechanisms on competition and firm strategy have been well documented in the literature, research on their impact on customer behavior has received less attention. In this study, the authors investigate the role of personal network effects and switching costs in explaining customer choice in the Spanish mobile telecommunications industry. Personal network effects are present when an individual user's utility increases more when some individuals adopt (social network) than when others do. Switching costs refer to costs associated with the process of switching from one provider to another. In addition, this paper studies the drivers of personal network effects and switching behavior. The results reveal that personal network effects and switching costs play a key role in determining mobile users’ choice: the probability that a customer selects a mobile phone company increases with the number of members of her social network already subscribed to that firm, and switching costs are significantly present in the mobile phone market making switching providers costly. Concerning the drivers of both mechanisms, the authors find that relationship characteristics (length, depth and breadth) and demographics differently affect personal network effects perceptions and consumer switching behavior.

641,002211,Telstra's National Telemarketing Centre,"Richardson, Paul and Weill, Peter",eng,"Telstra – until recently Australia's only telecommunications carrier – is internationally recognized within the industry for providing a world-class telecommunications service to a highly dispersed and isolated population under challenging environmental conditions. In 1990, the Australian Government announced that it would end Telstra's monopoly and move towards a deregulated telecommunications industry. The first step was a competitive duopoly and, in 1991–1992, a private carrier – Optus Communications – became Telstra's first competitor in the Australian market-place. On 1 July 1997 the industry was fully deregulated. Over this period, Telstra has undergone enormous changes – none of which is more dramatic than the shift from an engineering-driven organization, to one with a marketing focus. The shift in emphasis from engineering to marketing is clearly reflected by the establishment of Telstra's National Telemarketing Centre (NTC). Though originally created in response to deregulation and the threat of its first competitor, the NTC has grown to become a major national marketing channel for Telstra, as well as providing national customer and product support services. This case examines the function of the NTC within Telstra, the role of technology at the NTC and the way call centres affect organizational flexibility and change the relationship between Telstra and its customers.",217--234,3,14,1999,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629901400302,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629901400302,,,2210

644,001938,Deriving Semantic Data Models from Structured Process Descriptions of Reality,"Benwell, George L. and Firns, Peter G. and Sallis, Philip J.",eng,This paper begins by describing a generally accepted view of the contemporary information systems development process. This process assumes the direct derivation of a prototype from data models which have themselves been derived from a functionally decomposed representation of reality. The data models are constructed using entity-relationship modelling (ERM) and data flow diagram (DFD) techniques. The paper also considers the use of Petri net representations as structured process models of reality. These representations are a means of structuring the functional analysis of observed situations for which an information system design is required. The paper then suggests a refinement to the model just described. It examines the relationship between the ERM and DFD techniques and proposes the use of logical access mapping (LAM) as a method of synthesizing the product of these two data modelling activities. An example is used to illustrate the derivation of ERM and DFD from Petri nets. Also an example of the refined process model is given. ‘Weak links’ in this model are identified and further work towards establishing a method for formally proving data models is proposed.,15--25,1,6,1991,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629100600103,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629100600103,,,1937

In particular we stress the importance of the information structure of two-person games. We then provide a general game-theoretic interpretation of many key aspects of information systems outsourcing arrangements. In particular, we investigate the rationales behind many of the different ways of determining fees and the effects of the transfer of assets between the outsourcing company and the outsourcing vendor.

A key focus of the new wave of regulation is to ensure the removal of practices now deemed problematic with new controls for conducting transactions and maintaining holdings. There is increasing pressure on organizations to retire manual processes and adopt core systems, such as Investment Management Systems (IMS). These systems facilitate trading and ensure transactions are compliant by transcribing regulatory requirements into automated rules and applying them to trades. The motivation of this study is to explore the extent to which such systems may enable the alteration of previously embedded practices. We researched implementations of an IMS at eight global financial organizations and found that overall the IMS encourages responsible trading through surveillance, monitoring and the automation of regulatory rules and that such systems are likely to become further embedded within financial organizations. We found evidence that some older practices persisted.

A key focus of the new wave of regulation is to ensure the removal of practices now deemed problematic with new controls for conducting transactions and maintaining holdings. There is increasing pressure on organizations to retire manual processes and adopt core systems, such as Investment Management Systems (IMS). These systems facilitate trading and ensure transactions are compliant by transcribing regulatory requirements into automated rules and applying them to trades. The motivation of this study is to explore the extent to which such systems may enable the alteration of previously embedded practices. We researched implementations of an IMS at eight global financial organizations and found that overall the IMS encourages responsible trading through surveillance, monitoring and the automation of regulatory rules and that such systems are likely to become further embedded within financial organizations. We found evidence that some older practices persisted. Our study suggests that the institutionalization of technology-induced compliant behaviour is still uncertain.",44--58,1,29,2014,Journal of Information Technology,10.1057/JIT.2013.16,article,,,,1428

Knowledge embedded in an organization's business processes and an employee's skills provide a firm with unique capabilities for delivering a product or service to customers. Law firms represent an industry which seems very well suited for knowledge management investigation. Law firms are knowledge intensive and the use of advanced technology may transform these organizations in the future. To examine knowledge management in Norwegian law firms, a study which involved two phases of data collection and analysis was designed. The first phase was a field study of the largest law firm in Norway. The semi-structured interviews conducted in the initial field study documented a strong belief in the potential benefits from knowledge management. The second phase was a survey of Norwegian law firms. Firm culture, firm knowledge and use of information technology were identified as potential predictors of information technology support for knowledge management in law firms in Norway.

Using data from a matched survey of IT and business executives in 148 Chinese manufacturing firms, we reveal positive, significant links between IT support for core competencies and strategic flexibility, and between strategic flexibility and firm performance. The findings further show that the effect of IT support for core competencies on performance is partially mediated by strategic flexibility, and that IT infrastructure positively moderates the link between IT support for core competencies and strategic flexibility.

Many internal reasons led to the development of these strategies but external factors were also often present. Management structures were similar and tended to follow CCTA guidelines. The need to ‘'sell’ strategies was widely understood and regular reviews were planned. Strategies most frequently covered an implementation period of 5 years. In most cases, business objectives drove the definition of information requirements; and business issues included the need to improve efficiency, the impact of legislative change and problems caused by the creation of executive agencies. There was a widespread move towards Open Systems and security was tending to become a departmental issue. Expenditure on IT was frequently about 5–7 % of programme expenditure. Departments were reluctant to discuss the value of intangible benefits. Steady progress was being made with the implementation of strategies being subject to various problems and constraints. Lessons learnt included the needs for clear business goals, senior management involvement, managing users’ expectations and selling strategies.

It is also shown that market-maker's characteristics (reputation, website's usability and security) and seller's characteristics (expertise) play an important role in the formation and development of trust toward a market-maker and sellers, respectively.",119--132,2,22,2007,Journal of Information Technology,10.1057/PALGRAVE.JIT.2000095,article,,,,1574

674,002228,Evolutionary Software Development to Support Organizational and Business process Change: A Case Study Account,"Kawalek, Peter and Leonard, Jenny",eng,"This paper addresses the issues of software development in situations of organizational and process change. There is wide agreement in the literature that organizations have to be increasingly flexible in order to survive in the current economic climate. They must innovate, replicate, adapt and extemporize. As they do so, the requirements they have of their software applications are likely to change. Equally, as new software solutions are provided, new opportunities for business change arise. The situation is made still more complex because even if the needs of organizations were stable, we still could not be certain of the validity of an application's functions. This is because the process of program development is inherently uncertain. From this situation arise difficult, practical challenges for those concerned with the deployment of software in organizations. Starting with a consideration of the nature of organizations themselves, this paper takes looks at these problems by moving between three related points. It looks at software development methodologies and suggests that these have in the past tended to assume that discrete IT solutions can be cast for a ‘steady state’ which the organization is attempting to achieve. From the second vantage point it looks at the role of IT staff in supporting the operational needs of the organization. The third is the nature of software systems themselves.",185--198,3,11,1996,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629601100301,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629601100301,,,2227

Yet potential users are more concerned with the situations in which different approaches are appropriate. In this paper, five problem situation types are identified: (1) well-structured problem situations with a well-defined problem and clear requirements, (2) well-structured problem situations with clear objectives but uncertain user requirements, (3) unstructured problem situations with unclear objectives, (4) situations where there is a high user interaction with the system and (5) complex problem situations. Typical information systems development methodologies are placed in each of these groups. Some strengths and weaknesses of this classification are discussed. One conclusion is that most projects will fall within the category of complex problem situations, for organizations (and therefore their information systems needs) are invariably complex in terms of the human and social aspects at least as much as any technological ones.

With the recent advent of electronic commerce, new business models have emerged to capture the value of on-line electronic channels. In electronic channels, channel functions in particular can be combined creatively to reduce costs and improve responsiveness and can be dispersed among several different players. We argue that buying processes and channel functions in electronic channels are of a key strategic nature. This paper presents an analysis of the challenges and requirements of electronic channels and illustrates these with the KLM Cargo Cyberpets case. Cyberpets refers to Pets Travel Service, KLM Cargo's recent addition to its electronic commerce portfolio which organizes and facilitates air transportation plus ancillary services for cats and dogs. The existence of ‘Channel silos’ and channel coordination problems were found to be one of the main inhibitors for channel effectiveness and success.

Traditional models for predicting software implementation effort tie measures of code size and programming complexity to development time. ERP projects shift a significant proportion of the implementation effort from code development to the parameterization of a pre-existing software package. At the same time, they move complexity from technical to organizational factors since they force companies to adapt to predefined work processes embedded in the software. This paper redefines the concepts of size and complexity for ERP projects and empirically verifies their impact on implementation effort. Specifically, project size is measured in terms of the number of SAP modules and submodules that are implemented, while complexity is defined as the organizational scope of the project in terms of users involved and overall company size. Hypotheses are tested on 43 SAP/R3 projects conducted in a cross-section of manufacturing companies. The findings show that both the technical size and organizational complexity of projects are relevant drivers of implementation effort. The results indicate that implementation effort not only grows with the number of modules and submodules that are selected for implementation, but that SAP is found to require increasing resources to be implemented in larger companies and for a higher number of users, thus indicating that, while there is a technical component of effort that is independent of the organizational breadth of the project, each user adds an organizational component of costs.",33--48,1,16,2001,Journal of Information Technology,10.1080/02683960010035943,article,http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02683960010035943,51,,337

A literature search for an underlying theoretical basis for the concept of systems integration is made, highlighting a diversity of opinion. Two case studies are used to examine the meaning of integration relative to the images and ideals, theory and reality.

To help fill these gaps, we use five case studies on offshore migration of software work by major US companies. Data were collected from senior executives. We use these data to develop a dynamic conceptual model that incorporates three factor groupings which collectively help explain offshore sourcing outcomes: (1) economic factors; (2) the nature of the development activity; and (3) managerial capabilities and practices. Importantly, the model includes five feedback loops among sourcing decisions, sourcing mix, and these three factors. Thus, the relationships in the model are not unidirectional, nor static; rather, they are Iterative and dynamic, involving feedback loops, learning, and cumulative effects over time. In this dynamic model, the sourcing ‘mix,’ a continuously changing offshore portfolio, is a key firm-level dependent variable, closer to the economic concept of a ‘stock’ measure that represents the cumulative effect of sourcing decisions over time.

Bruce",eng,"Traditional EDI/VAN technology has been used for almost three decades and has brought its users significant advantages resulting in increased productivity and efficiency. However, implementation constraints have restricted the technology to predominantly large corporations, thus limiting EDI's reach to a broader base of small suppliers and customers. Internet-based EDI, with significantly fewer implementation constraints, can play an important role in extending EDI benefits to a wider spectrum of businesses. Recently published articles reflect a reluctance on the part of traditional EDI users to adopt this new communication modality. The reasons for this reluctance include the newness of the Internet technology, potential Internet legislation and lack of Internet standards plus the reliability and security of data transmission within the Internet environment. This paper examines these management issues and describes existing and potential solutions available to both new and traditional EDI users. Since few companies have embraced Internet-based EDI, this paper concludes with some successful Internet EDI-based cases.

With the recent advent of electronic commerce, issues in system deployment and user acceptance have become even more crucial. An experimental system, Stocknet, which is a departure from normal practice in the local stock exchange which still uses conventional methods for share transactions, was developed and subjected to a pilot test through a stock trading competition using live stock data. A research framework was developed with the main emphasis on the adoption and deployment of a broad-based Internet stock-trading platform in Singapore. A logistic regression analysis was conducted to predict user acceptance of a new system from a measure of their perceptions, beliefs and attitudes and usage behaviour. The study reveals that users’ concerns, expectations, perceived ease of use and the real value added of a new system as well as their trading behaviour are critical determinants to the ultimate adoption of Internet stock trading. In fact, the probability of users accepting a new system is highly dependent on their perceptions of system evaluations and subsequently their usage behaviour. The primary focus of this paper is on users’ perspectives with a view towards a subsequent examination of policy as well as regulatory issues. Based on the results, some broad recommendations and implications are subsequently drawn with regard to the future adoption and deployment of real-time, Internet-based stock trading.",81--94,2,13,1998,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629801300202,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629801300202,,,1983
697,000508,Anxiety and Psychological Security in Offshoring Relationships: The Role and Development of Trust as Emotional Commitment,"Kelly, Séamas and Noonan, Camilla",eng,"In this paper we focus on the neglected role of anxiety and psychological security in organizational life, specifically in the context of the organization and development of offshoring relationships that extend across time and geography. In contrast with much of the literature on offshoring (and inter-organizational relationships more generally), which tends to take a very conventional rational decision-making perspective on the phenomenon in question, we emphasize the less tangible, emotional dimensions. In particular, we are concerned with understanding the processes by which clients, who have little or no previous experience of offshoring, may develop and sustain adequate levels of psychological security to enable them to bracket risk and productively engage in such unfamiliar and alien work arrangements. To this end, we draw on Anthony Giddens’ distinctive, non-cognitivist conception of trust, supplemented by other important contributions in the area, to explore the processes by which a sense of psychological security and stability is achieved in the face of the quotidian anxieties provoked by engagement in these contemporary modes of global organizing. Our synthesized theoretical framework is developed and illustrated in the context of an ongoing, in-depth, longitudinal study of the evolution of an Ireland-India information systems offshoring relationship. By tracing the dynamics of this relationship over an 18-month period, we examine the practices (or ‘relationship work’) through which trust is produced, and suggest that different mechanisms can be discerned at different (albeit overlapping) stages of the relationship. In the earlier phase, the emphasis is on the role played by care and attentiveness in producing a sense of trust in the qualities of the supplier. As the relationship develops, however, the emphasis shifts to the production of a stable collaborative order. Here, we focus on the micro-political dynamics of such processes and draw attention to three important tactical interventions (brokerage, signaling, and the ‘third man’). We conclude by arguing that the sense of trust that was carefully cultivated in the earlier phase of the relationship provided a crucial foundation, which not only facilitated the subsequent development of a stable collaborative order but, most noticeably, helped contain a serious crisis that beset the project in December 2006.",232--248,4,23,2008,Journal of Information Technology,10.1057/JIT.2008.15,article,,32,,507

707,001901,Appropriate Technology for Humans and Organizations,"Clegg, Chris",eng,"This paper introduces the idea of ‘Appropriate Technology’ and applies it to some of the choices organizations make when designing, implementing and managing information technology (IT). It questions whether companies make appropriate choices about the extent of technology, the allocation of system functions between humans and machines, the design of jobs and roles for humans, the design of supporting organizational structures, and the methods used during design and implementation. If inappropriate choices are made in these areas, problems of morale, motivation and system performance can occur. The objectives of the paper are to examine whether these ideas can help to identify and explain problems in the implementation of new technology, and to argue that social scientists have so far achieved relatively little in helping organizations to make more appropriate choices in these areas. The paper makes a number of propositions about new technology from a social science perspective, introduces what is meant by Appropriate Technology, uses manufacturing as an example of an environment within which new technologies are being implemented, and describes five key decision areas for managers. As a result, a new set of propositions is made, this time from the perspective of general management and engineering.

While theoreticians are moving away from a positivistic approach towards a more interpretive approach, organizations are adopting a more entrepreneurial approach.

This paper uses an interpretive approach to explain the lack of success in introducing the new entrepreneurial evaluation procedures.

711,002278,Analyst and Programmer Stereotypes: A Self-Fulfilling Prophecy?,"Brooke, Carole",eng,"Previous research into the profiles of analysts and programmers has tended to present their attributes as virtually mutually exclusive and, in particular, has established a stereotype which favours the analyst for development as a manager. This view, historically reified through the division of labour between analysts and programmers and reinforced by the dual-track career paths of many organizations, intensifies the problems which technical staff experience when attempting to develop their potential. Using information from a case study conducted during 1989–1990 this paper proposes that the research profiles have become legitimized and reproduced at organizational level despite evidence of their inappropriateness. The relationship between management practice and documented theory has conspired to produce a self-fulfilling prophecy. However, the methodological basis of previous research is questionable and by recognizing these short-comings (compounded over a period of over 20 years) it becomes possible to critically re-evaluate beliefs about analysts and programmers. The paper argues for a more positive view of programmers and a more appropriate career structure for technical staff.",15--25,1,10,1995,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629501000103,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629501000103,,,2277

Some of the greatest opportunities for organizational improvement using IT are associated with the support of processes that cross functional boundaries. In this search for improvement, it is important to recognize that there are both process risks associated with business process redesign and structural risks associated with crossing functional boundaries. This paper proposes a model that relates the risks and rewards of IT-enabled change and reports on the experience of 59 organizations. The study found that organizations tend to emphasize either cross-functional business process redesign or intrafunctional automation projects. The results suggest that corporations that wish to take advantage of the rewards available from information technology-enabled change should recognize the risks associated with cross-functional change and process redesign.",267--275,4,9,1994,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629400900403,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629400900403,,,2132

The debate is typically characterized by tendentious arguments as advocates from each approach offer a somewhat one-sided condemnation of the counterpart from the inimical research tradition. This paper begins by relating two fictitious tales which serve to highlight the futility of research conducted at the extremity of each research approach. The dichotomies which characterize these rival factions are also summarized. The debate is then framed in terms of the polarization problem whereby IS researchers are divided geographically and paradigmatically into ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ camps. A variety of different strategies have been proposed for resolving the debate and these are discussed in detail. They are grouped into four categories, referred to as supremacism, isolationism, integration, and pluralism. Finally, the paper contends that the debate cannot be resolved, and offers the metaphor of magnetic polarity as a means of reflecting this. The paper concludes by arguing that it would be more appropriate to recast the debate at a macro level in order to accommodate different research agenda and recognize the strengths within each tradition.",313--326,4,13,1998,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629801300409,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629801300409,,,2137

725,002257,A Portfolio Approach to Evaluating Information Systems Investments and Setting Priorities,"Ward, John M.",eng,"The types of benefits which a business can obtain from investments in information Systems (IS) have developed and become more varied over time. During that same period many organizations have become dependent on their Information Systems in terms of how they do business and some have used IS to gain competitive or strategic advantages. This article explores the nature of the benefits that can accrue in relation to the business objectives of IS investments. A portfolio model is discussed which helps management evaluate the relative importance of such investments to the business and hence to define how each investment can be appraised and managed. In order to maintain a coherent strategy for managing IS investments, not only must they all be evaluated on a consistent basis, but priorities amongst the applications must be established on the same set of criteria. Again the portfolio approach enables management to address this issue in a rational way, based on business needs and imperatives.",222--231,4,5,1990,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629000500407,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629000500407,,,2256

729,001857,Understanding Slow Internet Adoption: ‘Infomediation’ in Ship-Broking Markets,"Pisanias, Nikolaos and Willcocks, Leslie",eng,"Debate on the impact of the Internet on socioeconomic and business environments has been dominated by technological determinist perspectives, narrowing the range of discourse around the implications of these new technologies. One important and neglected dimension is the impact on market relationships. Technological determinism suggests that the transactional efficiencies associated with the new medium should have a major impact on market structures. If that argument is correct, the case should be stronger in broking markets where information exchange, information mediation and communication flows are paramount. However, an examination of various broking markets reveals significant differences in the implications of this technological innovation. Drawing upon participant observation research conducted in 1998–99 in the shipbroking market, the paper explores the limitations of the technological determinist perspective and puts forward a model to explore the changing nature and dynamics of market relationships generated by information flows via the Internet. Application of the model helps to locate the reasons for slow adoption of the Internet in ship-broking markets.",399--413,4,14,1999,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629901400408,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629901400408,,,1856

It looks at the development of the IS function and the changing roles of IS practitioners in such organisations over the past 60 years, and assesses how they perceived themselves and were perceived by their peers, by business colleagues and by others. It uses the testimony of successful IS practitioners to provide a grounded perspective on the history of the IS worker over this time. The research identifies a trajectory of a gradual diminishment in the role and status of the IS worker in the corporation over the lifetime of the discipline. It observes that the IS worker has experienced changed fortunes: from a position of influence at the outset, leading to a peak of status and reward in the years up to the millennium; and to the present day where the occupation has a much lower profile. It ascribes this to the increasing commoditisation of IS, manifested by phenomena such as end-user computing, outsourcing and cloud computing.

Consequently, we sought to explore those actionable factors that might facilitate the effective realisation of benefits from systems development initiatives. Three organisations were identified that claimed to adopt a proactive approach to benefits realisation, and detailed studies of their systems development practices were conducted. Our analysis found that whilst one organisation had been successful in its adoption of a benefits realisation perspective, the other two had not, and this allowed us to identify those factors that helped to explain this difference in outcomes.

746,002375,A Comparative Study of Business to Consumer Electronic Commerce within the Australian Insurance Sector,"Costello, Graham I. and Tuchen, Jörg H.",eng,"Electronic commerce is causing fundamental changes in the insurance sector. Inherent opportunities of this innovative sales channel are driving the development of a new customer relationship paradigm, development of new products, pursuit of low cost ‘self service’ strategies, and emergence of ‘virtual brokers’. The Australian insurance sector is well positioned to take advantage of electronic commerce due to the high level of PC penetration, high Internet usage, and extensive broadband infrastructure. The perception is that the Australian insurance sector is meeting these challenges. Surprisingly, despite the emergence of electronic commerce as a ‘hot topic’ in the information technology and insurance sector literature, little empirical research has been reported. Much of the extant literature can be criticized as being too generic and superficial. It is argued that until research is focused on specific aspects of electronic commerce, we will fail to capture meaningful insights. The aim of this research project is to develop a research framework appropriate for electronic commerce, research and to apply it to a specific sector (insurance), in a specific geographical region (Australia), using a specific electronic commerce, medium (Internet), for a specific purpose (business to consumer sale of risk products). The research objective is to discover which Australian insurance companies are using electronic commerce for what. The survey found that of the 21 largest Australian insurance companies only 18 have web sites. These sites are mainly used for promotional purposes and not for directly generating sales. Only six companies offer customer-specific pricing of their products. And of these, only four companies sell any of their products over the Internet. Paradoxically, despite pressing business drivers in the insurance sector and a favourable electronic commerce environment in Australia, these findings demonstrate a significant gap between appreciation of the importance of electronic commerce and realization of commercial potential. Whilst most Australian insurance companies are well aware of the special importance of electronic commerce, many fail to take full advantage. Although further qualitative research is recommended to understand why this is so, it is clear that a significant gap remains between the technical capabilities of electronic commerce and actual practice in the Australian insurance sector.",153--167,3,13,1998,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629801300302,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629801300302,,,2374

One way of addressing this problem is to focus on how information is socially transformed into knowledge. This includes how knowledge is handled in practice and how the knowledge produced is qualified as being something worth knowing and acting upon. Two well-established practices for doing this are the refereeing system and the peer review process. These are used in scientific communities as a means of validating and legitimating knowledge, for example by reviewing journal papers before publishing or project proposals before granting funds, etc. This paper argues that peer review is a useful concept when looking at knowledge creation and legitimization in organizations. The social meaning of peer review is to legitimize new knowledge by organizationally sanctioning it and thereby creating a platform for collective sense making. This paper uses an example from a field study in a pharmaceutical company in order to illustrate this argument.

759,001971,"Common Knowledge, Interorganizational Networks and the Future for the Organization of Production","Borman, Mark",eng,"This paper seeks to investigate the potential for interorganizational networks (IONs) to facilitate a challenge to the current hegemony of integrated production. From a transaction cost perspective the choice between market and hierarchical modes of production depends upon their relative coordination costs. The argument developed here is that uncertainty has precipitated market failure and the consequent rise of large, integrated concerns. IONs, however, by facilitating the cost-effective diffusion of information can reduce the coordination costs associated with the market place and permit the deintegration of production. The greatest benefits are held to be realized where the development of common knowledge between connected trading partners permits the ‘free flow’ of information. Supporting empirical work consists of a comprehensive survey of the uptake of IONs in the Scottish electronics industry and the development of case studies in a variety of companies highlighting the specific processes at work. Tentative conclusions indicate that while IONs do represent an opportunity for the emergence of new, more collaborative modes of production such an outcome is by no means assured. ‘changes consist primarily in a relative decline in the importance of Fordist mass production and an enormous expansion of manufacturing activities based on less rigid and more highly adaptable (i.e., flexible) technological and institutional structures’ (Scott, 1988, p. 171).",203--212,3,9,1994,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629400900304,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629400900304,,,1970

The use of user-satisfaction is recognized by many IT researchers as an appropriate surrogate for IT effectiveness. The authors decided to use a user-satisfaction model which is based on the gap between users’ beliefs of what is important and their perception of what is delivered by the ISD, to measure the effectiveness of the personal computer network. In brief, the research showed that all was not well with the personal computer network in use. The gaps on the two perceptual performance factors, namely effective benefits and system access, are significant in assessing overall satisfaction with the network. The gap on effective benefits is approximately twice as important as system's access in terms of its impact on overall satisfaction. This research study showed that this gap approach is quite effective. It is inexpensive. It does not require an enormous amount of expertize, although an acquaintance with factor analysis is necessary. The study need not take a long period of time; the total lapse time for the above research was six weeks, requiring the equivalent of five person-days work.",162--175,3-4,6,1991,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/0268396291006003-406,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0268396291006003-406,,,2477

Many do not understand that there is more to a successful web site than having a corporate logo on a home page. They do not foresee the effort that goes into maintaining a web site, the increased competition from exposure to a ‘global market’ via the Internet and the impact a web site will have on the existing business. This case study allows analysis of the opportunities and risks of launching electronic commerce (EC) services in the case of the Co-op Bookshop, Australia's largest academic bookseller. The case describes Co-op's difficult progression to a profitable WWW presence and investigates potential developments due to growing competition from ‘global players’ and increasing amalgamation between bookselling over the WWW and electronic publishing. The case outlines the four possibilities by which a firm can profit from its Internet activities and transfers these general benefits to Internet service provision by bookstores. In particular, it directs attention to thinking of the core goals of the business, how a WWW presence helps to meet these goals and whether the introduction of a web site changes the direction of the business. This leads to a consideration of the nature of the web site. The case study allows exploration of the current customers and markets and why the firm focuses on these. Further, there are the issues of the resources required to set up and maintain a web site, how the site may be integrated into the existing business and its growth path.

The paper is both empirical in that it is based on survey data and theoretical as it postulates future developments. The essence of the argument is that management accountants have adapted to information technology and have been active in exploiting data processing systems since their inception. This experience and knowledge of the technology alongside their managerial abilities form powerful tools to enable their participation in developing information strategies. The development of an information strategy enables the matching of technology, information content and managerial activity to achieving the overall business strategy in the face of uncertainty. This clearly follows the proposal of accounting process to manage environmental uncertainty reflecting Lorange and Scott-Morton (1974), Hedberg and Jonsson (1978), Hedberg al.

We fill this void by exploring identity challenges that Swedish Road Administration (SRA) faced while implementing the Radio Data System – Traffic Message Channel (RDS – TMC) traffic information service. Through a longitudinal case study we follow how SRA's inherited expectations, guiding norms, and standards of sense-giving about its identity prevented it from becoming a flexible service provider within an emerging mobile ecosystem. We record a constant clash – the identity tension – between the old inherited identity of a public road administrator and the aspiring new identity of a digital service provider. To enact a successful identity change, SRA had to engage in a series of change episodes whereby it deliberately implemented new routines that forged novel relationships with actors within the ecosystem. This permitted SRA to gradually align its identity to the evolving needs of the RDS-TMC service ecosystem. Our findings suggest that deliberate attempts to implement innovative mobile services – especially those involving public-private partnerships – trigger intriguing identity ambiguities and role dilemmas, and future research should therefore focus on effective strategies to identify, manage, and resolve inherent identity tensions.",229--244,3,30,2015,Journal of Information Technology,10.1057/JIT.2015.8,article,,21,,603

799,001907,Achieving Flexible Information Systems: The Case for Improved Analysis,"Fitzgerald, Guy",eng,This paper examines the problems of change that continue to thwart the development of successful information systems. The symptom of maintenance is discussed and a variety of techniques and methodologies that seek to provide solutions are discussed. Changing business needs and user requirements are identified as enduring problems and the technique of Flexibility Analysis is proposed. Finally some preliminary results from a research study are discussed. The study looked at a number of information systems in organizations and examined the changes and enhancements that were subsequently made to those systems and the reasons for them. The results indicate the benefits and practicality of the technique of Flexibility Analysis.,5--11,1,5,1990,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629000500103,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629000500103,,,1906

This paper addresses this concern by investigating internal and external influences on accounting executives’ recommendations to outsource the IT infrastructure. Using resource-based and institutional theories, we hypothesize that when the chief information officer's (CIO's) skills are strong, accounting executives will more likely advise against outsourcing. But when the skills are weak, accountants are more likely to mimic the outsourcing actions of industry peers. Our findings support this expectation. These results should interest IS, accounting, and general management scholars. Strategic IT choices are a collegial decision which include contributions from multiple members of the top management team. Senior accounting executives are routinely involved in such evaluations, providing initial projections and monitoring the consequent progress. In addition, recent US regulations have made accounting executives personally responsible for the effectiveness of internal controls, including those over the IT infrastructure. The accounting executives’ recommendations on ITO in this context often becomes decisive, and factors behind this recommendation should be fully explored.",139--152,2,26,2011,Journal of Information Technology,10.1057/JIT.2010.19,article,,16,,114

803,002221,Division of Labour and the Design of Systems for Computer Support for Cooperative Work,"Eason, Ken",eng,The design of systems which provide computer support for cooperative work (CSCW) has been dominated by models of collaborative teams in academic or design environments. Such settings are characterized by a relatively egalitarian power distribution and a division of labour established locally by the collaborating parties. This paper describes other types of collaborative work in which the r&ocirc;les of participants are characterized by pre-established divisions of labour and unequal power distribution. A case study is presented of a collaborative group allocating and scheduling service calls in an electricity company. Using the Organizational Requirements Definition for Information Technology (ORDIT) methods for responsibility analysis a number of alternative organizational structures are described which may serve this task. The alternatives are based upon different job design structures which distribute responsibilities to work r&ocirc;les by different rationales. An analysis is offered of the different CSCW systems that would be necessary to support these alternatives. The paper concludes by examining the implications of pre-established but variable organizational structures for the design of generic CSCW systems.,39--50,1,11,1996,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629601100104,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629601100104,,,2220

Asynchronous groupware tools, such as electronic messaging systems, have found widespread use in organizations yet very little field research exists on how PI groups are affected by such tools. We try to fill this gap with a field study of the effects of asynchronous groupware support on seven PI groups in two New Zealand organizations. Our study indicates that, while not having perceived negative effects on group effectiveness, asynchronous groupware support was perceived as increasing process adoption, hierarchy suppression, departmental heterogeneity and contribution length and decreasing discussion duration, cost and interaction in PI groups. We argue that, based on these findings, the use of asynchronous groupware tools is likely to be beneficial in PI projects, particularly where a large number of PI groups proposing incremental process changes is conducted.",245--259,4,12,1997,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629701200402,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629701200402,,,2359

However, it can be associated with higher performance if accompanied by organizational change. The identification of the variables describing organizational change is still on-going work. This paper focuses on organizational absorptive capacity and analyses its effects on the relationship between IT and business performance in small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Organizational absorptive capacity measures the ability of an organization to complete a learning process. A significant learning effort is typically associated with IT, as it represents a complex technology. To cope with IT's complexity, implementation is typically incremental and is accompanied by a continuous integration effort of data and applications. The degree of integration of a company's information system (IS), called IS integration, is a proxy of IT maturity and quality. In this study, we explore the effect of IS integration on business performance through absorptive capacity, that is, we hypothesize that absorptive capacity has a mediation role between IS integration and business performance. The proposed research model is tested with data surveyed from 466 SMEs sited in Italy, for which exports constitute more than half of their revenues. Results indicate that organizational absorptive capacity has a mediation effect.

The primary goal is to provide a structured support for the selection of the minimum-cost architecture satisfying given organizational requirements. Previous empirical studies have attempted absolute cost comparisons of different architectural solutions, primarily relying on the expertise of practitioners and a priori beliefs, but have rarely taken into account the impact of organizational requirements on costs. Requirements are modelled as information processes, composed of tasks exchanging information and characterized by varying levels of computational complexity. Different architectural distributions of presentation, computation and data management applications are compared. The cost implications of organizational requirements for processing intensity, communication intensity and networking are analysed. The results show a relationship between structural features of information processes and architectural costs and indicate how architectural design should be based on organizational as well as technology considerations.",181--192,2,14,1999,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629901400207,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629901400207,,,2048

The study focuses on the IS strategic process. A theoretical framework is developed to examine the relationships between organizational and IS strategy formulation processes. The framework was evaluated in 56 organizations. Results of the analysis support the theory that different stages of growth in the use and development of IS require different approaches to strategy, and that different approaches to strategy are favoured by different organizational configurations. Evaluation of the relationship between organizational change and IS developments reveals a pattern of strategic alignment reflecting the interdependencies between the organizational configuration and the stage of IS growth. It would appear that transitions through this alignment model are characterized by periods of dynamic change which can be predicted at certain stages of growth. The model may prove useful both to assist in the management of organizational change and to identify appropriate IS strategy formulation approaches.",205--216,4,8,1993,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839629300800402,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839629300800402,,,1907

830,002276,Lessons from Enterprise Resource Planning Implementations in Ireland – Towards Smaller and Shorter ERP Projects,"Adam, Frédéric and O'Doherty, Peter",eng,"The enterprise resource planning (ERP) software market has been growing at a very fast pace over the last few years and has been predicted to keep growing rapidly in the long term. This has led to an abundance of media reports on the subject of ERP and to managers wondering whether their companies should implement ERP systems. In order to separate the reality of the ERP phenomenon from the hype that surrounds it, we studied 14 ERP implementation projects in Irish organizations and focused on the key relationships between organizations which attempt to implement ERP systems and their implementing partners. We found that the ERP implementations that are going on in Ireland at the moment are different to the projects that have been reported elsewhere in two key respects. Firstly, the organizations interested in ERP software are, on average, far smaller than the case studies reported in the literature and the majority of the cases we reviewed were small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Secondly, the durations of implementation were far shorter than reported elsewhere. These results are not surprising if one considers the smaller average size of Irish organizations, but they indicate that the ERP movement is truly ready for an extension towards the SME market. They also indicate that the duration of the implementation of ERP software may be related to the size and complexity of the client organization and that SMEs can expect to have an easier time implementing ERPs than the current literature suggests. We also found that software implementers play a key role, not only in technical terms, but also in managerial and political terms, because they can help their clients in correcting their expectations and perceptions of ERP systems and ERP implementations.",305--316,4,15,2000,Journal of Information Technology,10.1177/026839620001500406,article,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026839620001500406,,,2275

It is based on a questionnaire survey of software developers in UK organizations. CASE had a positive effect on developer productivity and the quality of applications software. It particularly improved the reliability and accuracy of applications software, though this was sometimes offset by a deterioration in software efficiency. There was little evidence of productivity being ‘traded’ for quality, since developers citing productivity gains also tended to report quality improvements. The extent to which organizations were able to realize the benefits of CASE depended on the experience, competence and training of individual developers. This has significant implications for the selection and training of personnel and the use of consultants.
