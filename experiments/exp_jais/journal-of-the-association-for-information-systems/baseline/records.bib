 abstract = {A defining concern for information systems (IS) is how to theorize its primary object of study, the digital artifact. Historically, approaches in IS have oscillated between technological determinist and social determinist ones. Bruno Latour’s works contributed to recalibrating a more symmetrical treatment of the two, and he played a distinctive role in stimulating the evolution of empirically committed, process-oriented theorizing in the IS field. We commemorate Latour’s work by revisiting his early influence on IS research and discuss some of the direct and indirect influences on contemporary IS, such as infrastructure studies and sociomateriality. With the interest in agentic technologies via AI, Latour’s perspectives on technological agency are more relevant than ever. In addition, we explore ideas that are relevant to IS but have yet to be taken up, thus representing untapped theoretical and methodological potential for future IS research—for example, approaching data as circulating reference or how his work could contribute to sustainability discussions in IS.},

@article{AbbasiChiangXu2023,
 abstract = {Data science has been described as the fourth paradigm of scientific discovery. The latest wave of data science research, pertaining to machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), is growing exponentially and garnering millions of annual citations. However, this growth has been accompanied by a diminishing emphasis on social good challenges—our analysis reveals that the proportion of data science research focusing on social good is less than it has ever been. At the same time, the proliferation of machine learning and generative AI has sparked debates about the sociotechnical prospects and challenges associated with data science for human flourishing, organizations, and society. Against this backdrop, we present a framework for “data science for social good” (DSSG) research that considers the interplay between relevant data science research genres, social good challenges, and different levels of sociotechnical abstraction. We perform an analysis of the literature to empirically demonstrate the paucity of work on DSSG in information systems (and other related disciplines) and highlight current impediments. We then use our proposed framework to introduce the articles appearing in the JAIS special issue on data science for social good. We hope that this editorial and the special issue will spur future DSSG research and help reverse the alarming trend across data science research over the past 30-plus years in which social good challenges are attracting proportionately less attention with each passing day},

 abstract = {With the ubiquity of the internet and social media platforms, open innovation (OI) opportunities now extend to individuals with creative ideas and interests in innovation. Understanding why individuals are willing to engage in open innovation and how their diverse goals affect their participation is important for assessing the viability of various OI models and to inform platform design. In this paper, we develop a theoretical model that examines the impact of three categories of human goals extrinsic, intrinsic, and internalized extrinsic on actors continuous intentions to participate in three general categories of open innovation behaviors: ideation, collaboration, and socialization. The model also considers how perceived platform participation affordances mediate the influence of goals on these innovation behaviors. We validate this goals-affordances-behavior model via a field survey of participants on a social product development (SPD) platform. By theorizing and empirically examining how goals influence participation in the SPD context, our study advances knowledge about open innovation behaviors, provides a foundation for future research across various OI models, and highlights practical insights for OI platform design.},

IT-mediated interruptions can disrupt flow, with ramifications for workers’ well-being and work performance. In this design science research paper, we develop and evaluate design knowledge for neuroadaptive flow support systems. Building on foundations in flow theory, we conduct expert interviews and present a conceptual framework, three meta-requirements, and five design principles for flow support systems. We then implement the design principles in three prototypes and evaluate these prototypes in a lab experiment and a field study. With this paper on flow and IT-mediated interruptions in the work domain, we present an approach toward flow support systems that enable intelligent interruption management.},

 abstract = {Information systems (IS) research has largely treated IS certifications (i.e., graphical cues that prove the endorsement of independent third parties) as universally effective at improving website visitors’ perceptions of trustworthiness. However, inconclusive findings on the effectiveness of IS certifications on websites have emerged, critically challenging their usefulness. We seek to reconcile these inconclusive findings by drawing on swift trust theory and the notion of humans as cognitive misers. Specifically, we investigate whether the effects of IS certifications are contingent on visitors’ expectations and the website’s baseline trustworthiness (i.e., the original website before adding and visitors’ processing of IS certifications). Through a multistudy investigation combining an online (N = 191) and a follow-up field experiment with up to €4 million in sales volume (N = 306), we reveal the contingent effects of IS certifications on the trustworthiness of websites: Below (but not above) a certain level of a website’s baseline trustworthiness (i.e., the trust tipping point), IS certifications significantly increase trustworthiness. We also show that IS certifications do not increase the likelihood of user registrations (i.e., trust-related behavior) when a website’s baseline trustworthiness surpasses this trustworthiness threshold. Overall, we provide an important new perspective that explains and resolves previous inconsistent findings on the (in)effectiveness of IS certifications for trustworthiness and subsequent trust-related behaviors. We equip practitioners with valuable and actionable guidance on the usefulness of IS certifications to strengthen their digital businesses.},

@article{AdjeridAngstDevarajEtAl2023b,
 abstract = {Organizations are increasingly using data analytics to help make decisions and drive positive outcomes. But organizational scholarship has warned us that the sort of information processing associated with analytic capabilities, while effective for uncertainty reduction, may be less effective in equivocal contexts. Equivocality is evident when tasks are not easily analyzable (task analyzability) or when organizational departments are highly differentiated (differentiation). We hypothesize that analytics will be less effective in driving positive outcomes when equivocality is high because of low task analyzability. However, when an organization is more differentiated, resulting in high equivocality, we anticipate that analytics will be more effective in driving positive outcomes. To test this theory, we studied how clinical healthcare analytics influenced experiential quality (akin to patient satisfaction) in over 3,000 hospitals across nine years. Our results show that analytics capabilities, on average, do improve outcomes in terms of patient experiential quality, suggesting that analytics can reduce uncertainty, but we also found evidence for the moderating role of equivocality. Specifically, as task analyzability decreases (i.e., increasing equivocality), clinical healthcare analytics becomes less effective in improving experiential quality. However, when equivocality is high because of differentiation, there is a positive relationship between clinical healthcare analytics and experiential quality but only in larger hospitals. From a managerial perspective, this study has implications for boundary conditions of data analytics in organizations.},

 abstract = {In this editorial, revisiting Alavi and Leidner (2001) as a conceptual lens, we consider the organizational implications of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) from a knowledge management (KM) perspective. We examine how GenAI impact the processes of knowledge creation, storage, transfer, and application, highlighting both the opportunities and challenges this technology presents. In knowledge creation, GenAI enhances information? processing and cognitive functions, fostering individual and organizational learning. However, it also introduces risks like AI bias and reduced human socialization, potentially marginalizing junior knowledge workers. For knowledge storage and retrieval, GenAI’s ability to quickly access vast knowledge bases significantly changes employee interactions with KM systems. This raises questions about balancing human-derived tacit knowledge with AI-generated explicit knowledge. The paper also explores GenAI’s role in knowledge transfer, particularly in training and cultivating a learning culture. Challenges include an over-reliance on AI and risks in disseminating sensitive information. In terms of knowledge application, GenAI is seen as a tool to boost productivity and innovation, but issues like knowledge misapplication, intellectual property, and ethical considerations are critical. Conclusively, the paper argues for a balanced approach to integrating GenAI into KM processes. It advocates for harmonizing GenAI’s capabilities with human insights to effectively manage knowledge in contemporary organizations, ensuring both technological advances and ethical responsibility.},

@article{AlibakhshiSrivastava2025,
 abstract = {The growing prominence of social media (SM) influencers as key content creators on SM platforms highlights the need for a nuanced understanding of factors that drive follower engagement. Taking a sentiment-theoretic perspective, we examine the interplay between image and text sentiment in multimodal SM posts to show that alignment with followers’ sentiment consistency expectations is crucial for enhanced follower engagement with influencers’ SM posts. Drawing on expectation disconfirmation and negativity bias theories, we explore the impact of sentiment divergence in multimodal SM posts and the moderating role of the follower community’s duality tolerance on follower engagement. Analyzing a dataset of 24,000 Instagram posts, our findings suggest that sentiment divergence between the image and text within the same SM post can reduce follower engagement. Specifically, when the text sentiment is less positive than the image sentiment (negative divergence), the detrimental impact on engagement is notably more pronounced, while posts where the text sentiment is more positive than the image sentiment (positive divergence) appear to be less affected. Additionally, we find that higher duality tolerance within an influencer’s community mitigates the negative effects of sentiment divergence on follower engagement. Our research contributes to the SM literature by highlighting the importance of sentiment divergence for SM influencers and their SM community’s duality tolerance orientation when they are designing posts. We further provide practical insights on how to craft multimodal SM posts that are effective in enhancing follower engagement.},

 abstract = {This study focuses on the impact of digitizing medical information on the efficiency and perceived quality of chronic care delivery at the individual physician level. This study extends the theory of task technology fit to activity systems consisting of highly interdependent tasks. We find that the outcomes of efficiency and quality gains are driven by the structure of interdependencies between tasks that physicians perform. While structured information plays a key role in enabling both decision-making and task execution, we find that physician-created semistructured information is also an important predictor of both efficiency and quality gains. We show that the structure of activity systems (task interdependencies) has a strong moderating influence on the factors that drive efficiency and quality gains. We find that digitization enables physicians to preprocess patients’ records prior to their visit which in turn drives gains in both the efficiency and the perceived quality of care delivered.},

@article{AsatianiMaloNagbolEtAl2021a,
 abstract = {The paper presents an approach for implementing inscrutable (i.e., nonexplainable) artificial intelligence (AI) such as neural networks in an accountable and safe manner in organizational settings. Drawing on an exploratory case study and the recently proposed concept of envelopment, it describes a case of an organization successfully “enveloping” its AI solutions to balance the performance benefits of flexible AI models with the risks that inscrutable models can entail. The authors present several envelopment methods—establishing clear boundaries within which the AI is to interact with its surroundings, choosing and curating the training data well, and appropriately managing input and output sources—alongside their influence on the choice of AI models within the organization. This work makes two key contributions: It introduces the concept of sociotechnical envelopment by demonstrating the ways in which an organization’s successful AI envelopment depends on the interaction of social and technical factors, thus extending the literature’s focus beyond mere technical issues. Secondly, the empirical examples illustrate how operationalizing a sociotechnical envelopment enables an organization to manage the trade-off between low explainability and high performance presented by inscrutable models. These contributions pave the way for more responsible, accountable AI implementations in organizations, whereby humans can gain better control of even inscrutable machine-learning models.},

 abstract = {This opinion paper aims, following a brief overview of the state of affairs of the academic publishing ecosystem, to shed light on a market failure that stems from commercial publishers harnessing that ecosystem for exorbitant profits at the expense of the scientific enterprise and society at large. The paper examines how emerging technologies can help the scientific community grapple with this predicament and reestablish an institutional logic that favors scholarship and world benefit over the economic interests of publishers. Building on Web3 technologies, the paper suggests a two-pronged strategy that relies primarily on blockchain and AI technologies to help restore a fair and equitable power balance and improve the publishing experience. This proposed course of action presents an opportunity to tackle the grand challenge faced by the academic publishing ecosystem while simultaneously asserting the IS community’s proclaimed role as stewards of the digital revolution. It is time for us to harness digital technology to transform our journals from monolithic monarchies to agile democracies.},

 abstract = {Sensors embedded in smart objects, smart machines, and smart buildings produce ever-growing streams of contextual data that convey information of interest about their operating environment. Although an increasing number of industries have embraced the utilization of sensors in routine operations, no clear framework is available to guide designers who aim to leverage contextual data collected from these sensors to develop predictive systems. In this paper, we applied design science research methodology to develop and evaluate a general framework that can help designers build predictive systems utilizing sensor data. Specifically, we developed a framework for designing context-aware predictive systems (CAPS). We then evaluated the framework through its application in MAN Diesel & Turbo, which served as a case company. The framework can be generalized into a class of demand-forecasting problems that rely on sensor-generated contextual data. The CAPS framework is unique and can help practitioners make better-informed decisions when designing context-aware predictive systems.},

@article{BabarCurleyKeEtAl2023,
 abstract = {We investigate how two digitally delivered nudges, namely light social support (nonverbal cues such as kudos or likes) and motivational messaging, affect employees’ self-reported physical activity in an online, corporate wellness program. Within this unique field setting, using data from several years, we found evidence that both types of nudges provide benefits beyond the effect of cash incentives. However, the effects vary by individual, depending on whether the employee is actively engaging in physical activity, and by time, depending on how long the employee has been in the wellness program. We found light social support to be less effective over time, while motivational messages were found to be more effective with the duration in the program and generally more effective for physically inactive users. Our findings have implications for the design of wellness systems, suggesting different approaches depending on an employee’s current activity level and tenure in the program},

@article{BaerWaardenburgHuysman2025,
 abstract = {The widespread implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in organizations has given rise to an increasing focus on augmentation in the academic and public discourse. While the verb “to augment,” defined as a process to make something greater or more numerous, is often used in IS research, it lacks a discussion of what the targets of such a process could be. In other words: What is augmented? Our paper builds on the literature of five research disciplines in which augmentation is a particularly prevalent topic—i.e., computer science, information systems, economics, management, and philosophy. Accordingly, we identified four metanarratives that represent four distinct targets of AI-based augmentation—the body, cognition, work, and performance—that build on unique human-AI configurations and bring to the fore specific augmentation tensions. Using these insights, we formulate avenues for further IS research on AI-based augmentation.},

 abstract = {Health analytics is the analysis of health data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can inform decision-making and drive healthcare improvements. While health analytics has considerable potential to improve healthcare and health outcomes, converting the potential value of health analytics to realized value is nontrivial. Further, the health analytics research context sits at the nexus of business, technology, computation, and health, making contributing to theory complex. To highlight opportunities in this space for theory contribution, this editorial and special issue offer guidance on and examples of how health analytics research can contribute to theory. In this editorial, we introduce four papers and suggest a number of research opportunities. Opportunities proposed in this editorial include: leveraging the health analytics context to open the black box of problemistic search, using emerging causal machine learning approaches to systematically generate new hypotheses from health-based data, addressing equity by improving the fairness of resource allocation decision-making in health processes, identifying patterns of human-AI collaboration in healthcare processes, and applying methods such as policy learning to health treatment assignment optimization.},

@article{BalozianBurnsLeidner2023,
 abstract = {Despite the increased focus on organizational security policies and programs, some employees continue to engage in maladaptive responses to security measures (i.e., behaviors other than those recommended, intended, or prescribed). To help shed light on insiders’ adaptive and maladaptive responses to IS security measures, we conducted a case study of an organization at the forefront of security policy initiatives. Drawing on the beliefs-actions-outcomes (BAO) model to analyze our case data, we uncover a potentially nonvirtuous cycle consisting of security-related beliefs, actions, and outcomes, which we refer to as an “adversarial dance.” Explaining our results, we describe a novel belief framework that identifies four security belief profiles and uncovers an underexplored outcome of IS security: insiders’ lived security experiences. We find that individuals’ unfavorable lived security experiences produce counterproductive security-related beliefs that, in turn, lead to maladaptive behaviors. Maladaptive behaviors create new potential for security risk, leading to increased organizational security measures to counter them. Thus, the adversarial dance continues, as the new security measures have the potential to reinforce counterproductive security-related beliefs about the importance and risk of IS security and lead to new maladaptive behaviors. To help situate our findings within the current security literature, we integrate the results with prior research based on extant theories. While this paper is not the first to suggest that security measures can elicit maladaptive behaviors, the emergent belief framework and expanded BAO model of IS security constitute an important contribution to the behavioral IS security literature.},

@article{BandodkarGrover2022,
 abstract = {In an increasingly digital world, C-level information technology experts (CITEs) such as CIOs and CTOs are playing an increasingly indispensable role in leading IT initiatives. Despite this, recent research shows a lack of oversight by the board of directors over the IT function due to the “IT confidence gap” of directors with no IT expertise. This has resulted in the emergence of a recent trend of appointing CITEs to the board of directors. However, there is little research on whether such appointments result in value creation for the appointing firms. We use perspectives from agency and resource dependence theories to examine two value impacts of CITE director appointments to address this question. We suggest that CITE director appointments create signaling value by enhancing the firm’s ability to signal their intention to institute more effective oversight of the IT function and subsequently accumulate value in the form of share price reaction to appointment announcements. Correspondingly, CITE directors’ human and relational capital application also creates substantive value in the form of firm financial performance over a longer duration. Using an event study and hierarchical linear modeling, our analysis of 334 CITE director appointments largely supports our contention that the human and relational capital of CITE directors and their appointment in firms facing IT-related contextual conditions results in both a positive share price reaction and better firm financial performance over the long term. We conclude that appointing CITE directors with the appropriate capital under certain contextual conditions leads to firm value creation.},

@article{BaoLeeZhangEtAl2025,
 abstract = {In crowdfunding, the disclosure of campaign details and progress is widely considered beneficial to fundraising because it can resolve information asymmetry and improve operational transparency. However, does this mean that fundraisers should frequently post updates? In this study, we aim to understand the implications of update frequency and content for fundraising in the context of medical crowdfunding. We deploy various natural language processing models to analyze the type, volume, and novelty of the information disclosed in updates and how funders perceive them. Our results delineate an inverted U-shaped relationship between update frequency and donations, contingent on content type. Specifically, we found that medical updates can resolve concerns and foster positive impressions among funders, which improves fundraising. However, as the update frequency increases, further posts may contribute to cognitive overload, attenuating the effect. In contrast, nonmedical updates are associated with a lower donation amount, as this type of update tends to contain redundant information and is negatively received by funders. This study contributes to crowdfunding literature by uncovering the unintended consequences of updates on fundraising due to reduced novelty and information overload. Our results suggest that theorizing the role of updates in medical crowdfunding needs to account for the two-sided nature of information disclosure. In particular, posting novel, issue-relevant information can initially reduce uncertainty and stimulate trust, positively influencing funding outcomes. However, overly frequent updates may include excessive details or repetitive content, adversely impacting fundraising.},

 abstract = {Social ties play a prominent role in individuals’ political decision-making. They influence partisan defections, political participation, voting decisions, and political information acquisition. Much of the literature focuses on personal social networks or geographically close networks. Yet one’s social network might also include acquaintances or other connections in more distant places that are maintained via online networks. In this study, we exploit Facebook’s Social Connectedness Index, which reflects social connections across the United States, and we investigate the role of social connectedness in political decision-making among individuals who are located across distant geographical regions. Our results suggest that social connectedness between counties has a homogenizing effect on voting for the same presidential candidate, either Democratic or Republican. On the other hand, social connectedness is likely to have a differentiating effect on voting for an independent or a third-party candidate. Moreover, this effect is moderated by the socioeconomic characteristics of the counties, such as education, race, population density, household income, industry, and gender composition.},

@article{BauerHeiglHinzEtAl2024a,
 abstract = {Machine learning (ML) models often endogenously shape the data available for future updates. This is important because of their role in influencing human decisions, which then generate new data points for training. For instance, if an ML prediction results in the rejection of a loan application, the bank forgoes the opportunity to record the applicant’s actual creditworthiness, thereby impacting the availability of this data point for future model updates and potentially affecting the model’s performance. This paper delves into the relationship between the continuous updating of ML models and algorithmic discrimination in environments where predictions endogenously influence the creation of new training data. Using comprehensive simulations based on secondary empirical data, we examine the dynamic evolution of an ML model’s fairness and economic consequences in a setting that mirrors sequential interactions, such as loan approval decisions. Our findings indicate that continuous updating can help mitigate algorithmic discrimination and enhance economic efficiency over time. Importantly, we provide evidence that human decision makers in the loop who possess the authority to override ML predictions may impede the self-correction of discriminatory models and even induce initially unbiased models to become discriminatory with time. These findings underscore the complex sociotechnological nature of algorithmic discrimination and highlight the role that humans play in addressing it when ML models undergo continuous updating. Our results have important practical implications, especially considering the impending regulations mandating human involvement in ML-supported decision-making processes.},

@article{BlutChongTsignaEtAl2022,
 abstract = {There are both formal and informal cries that UTAUT and, by association, the stream of research on technology adoption has reached its limit, with little or no opportunities for new knowledge creation. Such a conclusion is ironic because the theory has not been sufficiently and suitably replicated. It is possible that misspecifications in the various replications, applications, and extensions have led to the incorrect conclusion that UTAUT is more robust than it really is, leaving limited opportunities for future work. Although work on UTAUT has included important variables, predictors, and moderators, absent a faithful use of the original specification, it is impossible to assess the true nature of the effects of the original and additional variables. The present meta-analysis uses 25,619 effect sizes reported by 737,112 users in 1,935 independent samples to address this issue. Consequently, we develop a clear current state-of-the-art and revised UTAUT that extends the original theory with new endogenous mechanisms from different, other theories (i.e., technology compatibility, user education, personal innovativeness, and costs of technology) and new moderating mechanisms to examine the generalizability of UTAUT in different contexts (e.g., technology type and national culture). Based on this revised UTAUT, we present a research agenda that can guide future research on the topic of technology adoption in general and UTAUT in particular.},

@article{BurlesonGroverThatcherEtAl2021a,
 abstract = {Individuals often blur the line between technologies used for personal means and those used to complete work-related tasks. The increasing level of capabilities offered by personal technologies presents opportunities to repurpose them for work. With guidance from representation theory, we describe how cross-context representational fidelity predicts repurposing intentions across domains of use (e.g., personal to work-related). An empirical study of 311 full-time employees demonstrates that congruence between prior technology use and potential work use increases an individual’s belief that a technology can be useful for work purposes. Furthermore, we show that, in repurposing situations, usefulness is also influenced by an individual’s confidence in using the technology on a work device(s). These findings, among others, shed new light on our understanding of the influence of experience on repurposing technologies for use in the professional domain.},

 abstract = {Social media is one of the most disruptive technologies in executing a firm’s digital business transformation strategies. Does the firm’s ability to use social media affect its proficiency in exploring and exploiting knowledge? What should be the role of business analytics talent in this equation? We study theoretically and empirically these cutting-edge research questions. Our proposed research model argues that social media capability enables the development of knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation, and business analytics talent exerts a positive reinforcing role in the impact of social media on knowledge exploration. We empirically tested the proposed research model with a secondary dataset from a sample of US firms using PLS path modeling. After running a robustness test by estimating eight alternatives/competing models, the empirical analysis revealed that social media capability is positively related to knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation, but with a stronger effect on knowledge exploration. Moreover, business analytics talent plays a positive moderator role in the relationship between social media capability and knowledge exploration. This study contributes to the IS research by (1) introducing, developing, and operationalizing the concepts of social media capability and business analytics talent; and (2) theoretically arguing and empirically showing the pivotal role of social media capability in exploring new knowledge and the complementary role of business analytics talent. Our study also provides several critical lessons learned for top executives and proposes promising future IS research avenues.},

 abstract = {Social media firestorms pose a significant challenge for firms in the digital age. Tackling firestorms is difficult because the judgments and responses from social media users are influenced by not only the nature of the transgressions but also by the reactions and opinions of other social media users. Drawing on the heuristic-systematic information processing model, we propose a research model to explain the effects of social impact (the heuristic mode) and argument quality and moral intensity (the systematic mode) on perceptions of firm wrongness (the judgment outcome) as well as the effects of perceptions of firm wrongness on vindictive complaining and patronage reduction. We adopted a mixed methods approach in our investigation, including a survey, an experiment, and a focus group study. Our findings show that the heuristic and systematic modes of information processing exert both direct and interaction effects on individuals’ judgment. Specifically, the heuristic mode of information processing dominates overall and also biases the systematic mode. Our study advances the literature by offering an alternative explanation for the emergence of social media firestorms and identifying a novel context in which the heuristic mode dominates in dual information processing. It also sheds light on the formulation of response strategies to mitigate the adverse impacts resulting from social media firestorms. We conclude our paper with limitations and future research directions.},

 abstract = {In this study, we investigate information system (IS) failures by leveraging a novel construct—dissonant relational multiplexity (RM)—to develop a unique perspective of these failures. Dissonant RM exists when two organizational stakeholders have multiple types of relationships that are in conflict. To investigate the salience of dissonant RM in IS failures, we use a case study combined with the analysis procedures of the grounded theory methodology (GTM) to examine a major failure in enterprise resource planning (ERP) implementation. Our analysis and theorization highlight that RM became increasingly dissonant in the relationships between key organizational stakeholders because of a shift in technological frames that represent cognitive perceptions about technology. Further, a key insight from our findings is that the move to dissonant RM occurred through a process that we term relational unbalancing. In addition, we also found evidence of an opposing relational balancing process that was used by stakeholders to address dissonant RM. Such stakeholder efforts were often undermined by inherent constraints in the implemented technology. The relational balancing efforts were not productive, and the dissonant RM continued to exist, ultimately contributing to the failure of the ERP implementation. Our study shows that IS failures are characterized by elements of both determinism and indeterminism, are undoubtedly sociotechnical in nature, and are shaped by technological constraints and stakeholder perceptions of those constraints. From a practical standpoint, our study highlights the importance of managing multiplex stakeholder relationships in an IS implementation process, especially when the multiplexity is shaped by the technology.},

@article{CheePhangLiaoEtAl2023,
 abstract = {With the development of mobile communication technologies, people can now engage in seamless communications with family members and coworkers at both home and work. When promoting a new mobile communication technology (e.g., the 5G network), firms may be tempted to emphasize how the technology can strengthen communication both within and across the two domains with the hope of improving purchase rates. Yet research has suggested that people may perceive mobile communication differently depending on whether those they are communicating with others who belong to the same domain. Thus, the promotion of the technology to potential users should perhaps consider users’ location domain and their communication targets. Through a field experiment, we show that when promoting mobile communication technology in the home domain, highlighting prevention-focused communication promotes greater purchase rates. However, at work, when coworkers are the target of communication, highlighting promotion-focused communication works better. These findings can not only help practitioners design more effective promotional messages in promoting mobile communication technologies but also contribute to the understanding of nuanced differences in the nature of mobile communication that make it more appealing to users in different within- and cross-domain communication scenarios.},

 abstract = {Professional question-and-answer (Q&A) communities have become important online social media platforms for peer-to-peer knowledge production. Such communities are vital for users seeking technical solutions and innovative methods for developing new products and features. A key challenge is ensuring information flows across areas of specialization, as such communities thrive on access to diverse expertise. Yet we know little about how a user’s network brokerage (i.e., the extent to which the user bridges structural holes between groups in the Q&A social network) and related reinforcement mechanisms impact continued user engagement, particularly in contexts where balancing efficient solutions and innovative recommendations from diverse users creates tension. Drawing on the molar theories of structural holes and reinforcement, this study proposes a moderated mediation research model set at the middle range (i.e., with deep connection to the empirical context) that explains the underlying mechanisms in the relationship between Q&A community network brokerage and continued knowledge production. Based on a panel dataset from Game Development Stack Exchange, we find that: (1) network brokerage indeed fosters knowledge receipt, which in turn reinforces users to continue knowledge seeking and contribution; (2) knowledge receipt partially mediates the effects of network brokerage on continued knowledge seeking and contribution; and (3) user tenure negatively moderates the indirect effects of network brokerage on continued knowledge seeking and contribution through knowledge receipt. This research offers theoretical and practical implications for designing and managing online communities dedicated to peer knowledge production.},

@article{ChengBalaTan2025,
 abstract = {Product-related content created by social media influencers plays a crucial role in shaping consumer purchase decisions. Social media endorsements, as reflected in “likes,” serve as a key indicator of an influencer’s success and provide brands and platforms with valuable insights into how social media users perceive and engage with product-related content. This study theorizes and examines how and why incorporating a product link into influencer-generated content affects individuals’ social media endorsement behavior. Our empirical analysis, based on 216,973 product-related posts from 6,188 influencers on a social media platform, suggests that (1) the inclusion of a product link is associated with more social media endorsement, (2) this effect is more pronounced for organic (non-sponsored) content than for sponsored content, and (3) product links are more effective in increasing social media endorsements for influencers who generate content more intensively (i.e., frequently). To examine the underlying mechanisms driving these effects, we conducted a controlled experiment simulating our research context (N = 428). The findings suggest that the positive effect of product links on social media endorsement arises from enhancing perceptions of helpfulness while mitigating perceptions of ulterior motives, particularly in organic content. This research makes significant theoretical contributions to the literature on user-generated content, user engagement, and influencer marketing, offering actionable guidance for influencers, brands, and social media platforms.},

@article{ChenPrestonSwink2021a,
 abstract = {This study investigates how different types of “big data analytics” (BDA) usage influence organizational decision-making in the area of supply chain management (SCM). Drawing on decision-making theory and organizational information processing theory, we conceptualize two patterns of BDA usage for supply chain (SC) activities (BDA use for SC optimization and BDA use for SC learning) and report two complementary channels via which the two BDA usage patterns impact a supply chain organization’s BDA-enabled decision-making capability. An analysis of questionnaire data from supply chain managers representing 157 companies based in North American suggests that BDA use for SC optimization is directly associated with better decision-making capability. In contrast, the influence of BDA use for SC learning does not impact decision-making directly but indirectly, as its effect is fully mediated by organizational integration. We discuss the implications of these findings for future academic research and for managers in practice who seek to maximize business values from BDA implementations.},

@article{ConnollySanchezCompeauEtAl2023,
 abstract = {Online health communities (OHCs) represent a popular and valuable resource for those seeking health information, support, or advice. They have the potential to reduce dependency on traditional health information channels, increase health literacy and empower a broader range of individuals in relation to their health management decisions. Successful communities are characterized by high levels of trust in user-generated contributions, which is reflected in increased engagement and expressed through knowledge adoption and knowledge contribution. However, research shows that the majority of OHCs are composed of passive participants who do not contribute via posts, thereby threatening the sustainability of many communities and their potential for empowerment. Despite this fact, the relationship between trust and engagement, specifically the trust antecedents that influence engagement in the OHC community context has not been adequately explained in past research. In this study, we leverage social capital behavior and social exchange theory frameworks in order to provide a more granular trust-based elucidation of the factors that influence individuals’ engagement in OHCs. We collected data from 410 Brazilian participants of Facebook OHCs and tested the research model using partial least squares. The results confirm two new constructs—online community responsiveness and community support—as trust antecedents that influence engagement in OHCs, resulting in knowledge adoption and knowledge contribution responses. These findings contribute to the trust and engagement literatures and to social media research knowledge. From a practitioner perspective, the study findings can serve as an important guide for moderators and managers seeking to develop trusted and impactful OHCs.},

@article{ConstantiouJoshiStelmaszak2023,
 abstract = {Digital transformation has become a dominant phenomenon of interest among information systems scholars. To account for this phenomenon, it is imperative to develop a theoretical understanding of its processes and objects. We adapt a seminal organizational theory that conceptualizes organizations as interpretation systems to a possible future of organizations. We theorize digital transformation as a progressive replacement of humans by digital technologies in performing an organization’s fundamental activities underpinning the processes of scanning, interpretation, and learning that encompass an organization’s interaction with its environment. As a result, organizations cease to be human interpretation systems and instead turn into digital enactment systems, where digital technologies, instead of humans, nearly autonomously create and act upon information. We illustrate this digital transformation theory using the example of high-frequency trading. This transformation redefines the relationship among organizations, information, and the environment, changing the role of humans and reshaping strategic decision-making. Thus conceived, digital transformation offers a concrete way of theorizing and accounts for deep implications on the nature of organizations and organizing in the digital age.},

@article{CurtoMilletCanibano2023,
 abstract = {Are social inclusion and social exclusion opposed? Through a three-year ethnography of an open source civic crowdsourcing platform aiming for generalized social inclusion, we show they are not. We argue that social inclusion and exclusion have a paradoxical relationship: ongoing tensions exist between them, and information systems shape those tensions. We find that design choices have crucial influence over the capacity of information system interventions to include and exclude and propose a framework for designing IS-based social inclusion interventions. The framework encompasses four types of strategies (positive discrimination, integrative oscillation, equitability and iterative inclusivity) for managing the paradoxical link between inclusion and exclusion through IS design. We also present the notion of “collectives” as a new way of thinking about exclusion criteria.},

@article{DArcyBasoglu2022,
 abstract = {Cybersecurity disclosures in reports filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) inform investors about firms’ cybersecurity incidents, risks, and related risk management efforts. Firms have traditionally chosen to communicate such information on a quarterly or annual basis, if at all, and prior research on the topic has largely focused on regulatory factors as driving forces. In this paper, we focus on timely disclosures (via 8-K filings) and derive hypotheses regarding the influences of two alternate forms of pressure as drivers of cybersecurity disclosures—(1) public pressure following a firm’s data breach and (2) pressure arising from the breaches of industry peers, which we cast as “institutional pressure.” We also theorize on how the source of the breach (internal or external) influences these forms of pressure. Our results suggest that firms’ cybersecurity disclosure practices are influenced by public pressure following a data breach and that this pressure is more acute for external breaches than for internal breaches. By contrast, breaches by industry peers, as a form of institutional pressure, appear to prompt fewer cybersecurity disclosures, except when the focal firm suffers its own external breach. From a theoretical perspective, our study supports a nuanced application of legitimacy theory in the cybersecurity disclosure context, especially in the midst of public and institutional pressure, such that the source of a data breach determines whether firms attempt to address the resultant legitimacy gap. From a practical perspective, our results may be viewed as alarming in that firms are not reacting to internal breaches with the same degree of communicative effort about cybersecurity as for external breaches, at least in terms of the timely disclosures we consider in this study. Our findings also point to certain levers that can promote timely cybersecurity disclosures, and thus have important policy implications.},

 abstract = {Action research (AR) has developed extensively since the 1970s. We reviewed the AR literature within the information systems (IS) discipline and found 16 different methods, which constitutes a problematic situation for researchers. We describe and critique those methods before integrating their strengths to improve the AR method that is most frequently practiced in IS: canonical action research (CAR). The existing set of principles and criteria for CAR is modified and elaborated to enhance the foundation for undertaking AR consistently. We discuss the general implications of this improved form of the method, which we name integrated action research (IAR). We specifically suggest how IAR can be used to investigate the application of disruptive technologies, including those that embody artificial intelligence and enable more flexible and socially distanced work.},

@article{DengGalliers2024,
 abstract = {The rise of the digitally enabled gig economy has prompted debate about gig working conditions and labor regulation, calling for research on the interactions between gig workers and digital labor platforms (DLPs). This study examines the working conditions on place-based and remote-work platforms by focusing on worker perspective and addressing two questions: What risks do workers perceive when engaging in different types of gig work? How is labor agency exercised on different digital labor platforms? To answer these research questions, we chose a comparative qualitative case-study research design and drew on labor agency theory to use the classification of resistance, resilience, and reworking as a starting point for categorizing labor agency actions on different DLPs. Narratives of workers through semi-structured surveys were collected from 102 California-based gig workers registered on three types of DLPs: delivery, ridesharing, and microtask crowdworking. Our thematic analysis shows that workers on the three types of DLPs shared four types of risk—employment, financial, mental health, and technological—but the frequencies of these risks differed across the platforms. Two risks—entrepreneurial and physical health risks—were primarily perceived by workers engaging in delivery and ridesharing. The study reveals that workers’ enactment of the three types of labor agency (resistance, reworking, and resilience) varied by risk types and DLPs and provides a nuanced understanding of the gig work risks and worker agency across DLPs, extending labor agency theory from traditional workplaces to gig work environments.},

@article{DeyLahiriMukherjeeEtAl2025,
 abstract = {A major policy concern emerging in recent years is whether social media platforms, driven completely by profit motivations, create divisions within society and inject bias into their user base. A related question is: How should a policymaker intervene if these allegations prove to be true? In this study, we set up a microeconomic model to study whether a platform’s profit motivation may indeed compel it to adopt a user-targeting strategy that injects bias and creates polarization. We then examined how a policymaker might intervene and whether there are unintended consequences of such interventions. In doing so, we discovered an interesting duality between polarization and bias—both can add to the platform’s coffers but might act as substitutes in its profit function. If policymakers try to crack down on polarization, it could end up making the platform switch to bias instead. Finally, we examined the role of public awareness in moderating the platform’s desire for profit. Our results provide broad insights into a platform’s incentives and contribute to the public debate on this issue.},

@article{DiederichBrendelMoranaEtAl2022,
 abstract = {Conversational agents (CAs), described as software with which humans interact through natural language, have increasingly attracted interest in both academia and practice because of improved capabilities driven by advances in artificial intelligence and, specifically, natural language processing. CAs are used in contexts such as peoples private lives, education, and healthcare, as well as in organizations to innovate or automate tasks for example, in marketing, sales, or customer service. In addition to these application contexts, CAs take on different forms in terms of their embodiment, the communication mode, and their (often human-like) design. Despite their popularity, many CAs are unable to fulfill expectations, and fostering a positive user experience is challenging. To better understand how CAs can be designed to fulfill their intended purpose and how humans interact with them, a number of studies focusing on human-computer interaction have been carried out in recent years, which have contributed to our understanding of this technology. However, currently, a structured overview of this research is lacking, thus impeding the systematic identification of research gaps and knowledge on which future studies can build. To address this issue, we conducted an organizing and assessing review of 262 studies, applying a sociotechnical lens to analyze CA research regarding user interaction, context, agent design, as well as CA perceptions and outcomes. This study contributes an overview of the status quo of CA research, identifies four research streams through cluster analysis, and proposes a research agenda comprising six avenues and sixteen directions to move the field forward},

 abstract = {Microlabor markets engage workers in temporary employment contracts to complete short-duration tasks for micropayments. Because microlabor platforms often preclude worker interaction, independent microtasking communities have emerged to allow workers to exchange ideas and interact to improve their work performance. Research has yet to take an in-depth look at how workers utilize microtasking communities to mitigate unpaid coordination costs to improve their financial productivity. The present study uses political skill as a theorizing lens to investigate how microtask workers utilize the capabilities of these communities that influence their ability to avoid financial marginalization. Using pseudo-ethnography and thematic analysis, we employed a sequential mixed methods design to identify how community capabilities and ideological beliefs influence worker performance. These insights then informed the design of an empirical study using survey data from 253 Amazon Mechanical Turk workers who use microtasking communities to test our research model. We found that politically skilled individuals use community capabilities, subsequently influencing their hourly wage. We also found that microtasking ideology weakens the effects of political skill on community capabilities and their influence on hourly wages. We discuss several contributions to the political skill and microtask literature.},

@article{DingerThatcherGroverEtAl2022,
 abstract = {Over the course of their careers, IT professionals become embedded in their workplace. In the organizational behavior literature, research has found that job embeddedness provides direct, positive benefits for employers, including lower turnover intentions, lower levels of withdrawal behaviors, lower actual turnover, and more. In this paper, we present a more nuanced view, namely that embeddedness among IT professionals may influence the development of professionalized mindsets, which, in turn, has a mix of positive and negative consequences. To understand these relationships, we introduce a concept called workgroup embeddedness (WGE). WGE captures how IT professionals become embedded in their organizational workgroup or unit. We report a multiphase study that (1) developed a measure of WGE, (2) established the validity of WGE, and (3) evaluated the implications of WGE among 150 IT professionals using data collected at two points in time. We found that WGE drives an increase in professionalism, which, in turn, increases work-life conflict. Also, we found that both WGE and professionalism positively influence organizational citizenship behaviors. These findings indicate that WGE may play a role in socializing and driving more professionalized mindsets among IT professionals, such as professional identification, which leads to positive outcomes like citizenship behaviors but may come at the expense of negative consequences in professionals’ nonwork lives. Post hoc findings highlight that belief in public service and identification with the IT profession influence work-life conflict and organizational citizenship. We conclude with implications for research and practice.},

 abstract = {The promise of AI for academic work is bewitching and easy to envisage, but the risks involved are often hard to detect and usually not readily exposed. In this opinion piece, we explore the feasibility, opportunities, and risks of using large language models (LLMs) for reviewing academic submissions, while keeping the human in the loop. We experiment with GPT-4 in the role of a reviewer to demonstrate the opportunities and the risks we experience and ways to mitigate them. The reviews are structured according to a conference review form with the dual purpose of evaluating submissions for editorial decisions and providing authors with constructive feedback according to predefined criteria, which include contribution, soundness, and presentation. We demonstrate feasibility by evaluating and comparing LLM reviews with human reviews, concluding that current AI-augmented reviewing is sufficiently accurate to alleviate the burden of reviewing but not completely and not for all cases. We then enumerate the opportunities of AI-augmented reviewing and present open questions. Next, we identify the risks of AI-augmented reviewing, highlighting bias, value misalignment, and misuse. We conclude with recommendations for managing these risks.},

 abstract = {Information systems development frequently involves value conflicts (e.g., reconciling compliance requirements with user autonomy), thereby requiring developers to engage in moral decision-making regarding what is desirable, right, and just. Drawing on the theory of moral development, this study examines how developers—whose moral reasoning emphasizes self-interest (pre-conventional), maintaining social norms (conventional), or higher-order principles (post-conventional)—navigate these conflicts. We identify varying moral decision-making patterns among developers at the pre-conventional, conventional, and post-conventional levels, structured around four interrelated themes: (1) problem framing, (2) solution conceptualization, (3) responsibility orientation, and (4) duty fulfillment. Our analysis further indicates the pivotal role of developers’ responsibility orientation in guiding moral decision-making. Specifically, this orientation encompasses how developers attribute causal responsibility (e.g., assigning blame) in framing problems, allocate accountability (e.g., taking ownership) in conceptualizing solutions, and balance obligations (e.g., honoring commitments) in fulfilling their duties. Thus, our study shows how distinct responsibility orientations among IS developers at the pre-conventional, conventional, and post-conventional levels critically shape their navigation of value conflicts, ultimately influencing project outcomes.},

@article{ErikssonOhlund2024,
 abstract = {Digital institutionalization processes are fundamentally changing society. They occur when rules and norms are encoded into a digital infrastructure and change practices. For institutionalization to occur, numerous actors must alter their behavior similarly, which accompanies a shift in infrastructural technology. Digital infrastructures and their design play a crucial role in institutionalization processes, as they enable and restrict social interaction in the exchange of digital institutional entities across contexts. Such entities are constitutive of digital institutional systems—medical prescriptions, money, insurance, and taxes are all institutional entities that have been digitalized. Although several studies have described the challenges of digital infrastructure design, there has been little consideration of the institutional context that legitimizes the design. To fill this research gap, we applied the critical perspective of designers, who intentionally perform and are responsible for the design and legitimacy of digital institutional systems. To address the challenge of institutional design, we developed an exchange contract within an institutional context featuring a change in digital infrastructure and practices. Through this, we illuminate several design principles for digital institutionalization. This contribution captures critical design decisions and the knowledge acquired through insights gained from the design of a highly impactful scalable digital infrastructure, which ultimately transformed an institutional system. We also provide theoretical reflections informed by speech act theory and institutional theory and thereby emphasize the need to rethink institutionalization processes in an era of digitalization.},

 abstract = {Process mining is a set of analytical techniques aimed at gaining insights into business processes in organizations. Recently, information systems scholars have recognized its potential for analyzing human behavior through digital trace data. In this paper, we draw on the conceptual and technical analogies between business processes and human behavior to thoroughly investigate the application and transfer of process mining techniques to the analysis of human behavior. This analysis, called human behavior mining (HBM), is conceptualized as a four-part framework. To illustrate HBM’s research potential, we apply this framework in an mHealth scenario. We explore dynamic concepts proposed by social cognitive theory to analyze changes in physical activity behavior through digital trace data collected through a dedicated app. This exemplary application demonstrates that HBM can be used to empirically test previously unspecified and uncontested dynamic concepts in human behavior. It also highlights HBM’s suitability for health analytics, given the vast amount of health-related behavior data available through apps and wearables, and the direct connection between behavior and health-related outcomes. Our research provides a dynamic and temporal perspective on human behavior, showcasing the potential of HBM to enrich theoretical frameworks in IS research.},

@article{FengHuWuEtAl2023,
 abstract = {Help-request referral (HRR) campaigns are being increasingly adopted by online service providers to attract online traffic and engage new users. In these campaigns, participants are required to collect a specific amount of help from their social network in exchange for attractive rewards. Participants often face challengesin obtaining positive feedback from their social networking groups due to the diffusion of responsibility. Based on the triangle model of responsibility, this study proposes and empirically tests a research model that examines two key determinants (i.e., request personalization and relational closeness) of recipients’ perceived responsibility that further shape their responses to HRR. Our field experiment empirically supports the research hypotheses. Overall, this study enriches the literature on online social referrals by focusing on HRR, where social referrals are broadcasted and senders reap referral benefits. The study also provides practical insights for HRR designers and social networking service providers.},

Our empirical analysis shows that CIO structural power enhances corporate social performance (CSP) by fostering an innovative organizational culture. In addition, we find that CIO structural power amplifies the positive relationships between financial resource availability and CSP, as well as between employee productivity and CSP. These findings remain consistent across multiple robustness tests. By highlighting the multifaceted impact of CIO structural power on CSP, we aim to advance understanding of CIOs’ strategic role in corporate social responsibility.},

@article{FengYinKarEtAl2024,
 abstract = {Despite the proliferation of information technology applications worldwide, successful technology implementation in organizations remains a formidable challenge. Whether organizations can actualize the benefits of new technology depends critically on how end users evaluate and cope with it. Various intervention practices have been proven to be effective in facilitating user adaptation in the existing literature. However, research that systematically examines the impacts of intervention practices across implementation stages and usage contexts is still rare. Leveraging coping theory, we propose a 2×2 framework under the conditions of pre-/post-implementation stages and mandatory/voluntary usage contexts to investigate how various intervention practices adjust user appraisals of new technology via different coping mechanisms. We then extend the investigation into the downstream job outcomes and make comparisons of relevant relationships across usage contexts. Our empirical findings from two unique organizational settings, featured opposite degrees of usage voluntariness, support consistently significant effects of intervention practices, beliefs updating, and effects of usage behavior on job outcomes in both contexts while suggesting nuanced differences between the two contexts. Our research sheds light on how to manage technology implementations and help users cope with the change effectively in different contexts via various intervention practices in the technology implementation process.},

@article{FengZhouFengEtAl2024,
 abstract = {An increasing number of software firms are utilizing bug bounty programs (BBPs) to detect bugs and enhance their product quality by leveraging the contributions of external ethical hackers. Although launching a BBP involves bounties as well as the costs of processing bug reports and fixing bugs, software firms can save failure costs and enjoy the benefits of greater user trust. The costs and benefits resulting from launching a BBP vary with launch timings and software licensing models. Hence, we investigate the optimal BBP launch strategies for software firms, using perpetual or subscription licensing models. Our findings reveal that under perpetual licensing, the firm has only two viable launch strategies: simultaneous launch, i.e., launching the software and the BBP simultaneously, and no launch. Under subscription licensing, however, delayed launch, i.e., launching the BBP later than the software release time, occurs as the optimal strategy when the failure cost is not high and the benefit of user trust is significant. Two distinct patterns in the relationship between the firm’s bug-fixing capability and its payoff are identified: a U-shaped pattern and an inverted U-shaped pattern. We uncover the conditions under which a firm should opt not to launch a BBP as its bug-fixing capability improves. This study offers insights into how firms can be motivated to launch BBPs to improve the overall reliability of their software.},

However, despite the emergence of LinkedIn and a wide variety of other labor matching technologies (LMTs) that magnify qualifications visibility (QV) and shape it in non-obvious ways, there has been very little attention to QV as a concept, its antecedents, and its consequences. Accordingly, the objectives of this paper are to: (1) define QV and elaborate its dimensionality, (2) delineate how it is magnified and shaped by LMTs, (3) draw on theories of visibility, signaling, and strategic self-presentation to devise a theoretical model of labor search that places QV at its center, and (4) work through the implications of this model for future research on the influence of emerging LMTs and QV on labor search in an organizational context.},

 abstract = {Online experiments have become an important methodology in the study of human behavior. While social scientists have been quick to capitalize on the benefits of online experiments, information systems (IS) researchers seem to be among the laggards in taking advantage of this emerging paradigm, despite having the research motivations and technological capabilities to be among the leaders. A major reason for this gap is probably the secondary role traditionally attributed in IS research to experimental methods, as repeatedly demonstrated in methodological reviews of work published in major IS publication outlets. The purpose of this editorial is to encourage IS researchers interested in online behavior to adopt online experiments as a primary methodology, which may substitute for traditional lab experiments and complement nonexperimental methods. This purpose is pursued by analyzing why IS research has lagged behind neighboring disciplines in adopting experimental methods, what IS research can benefit from utilizing online experiments, and how IS research can reap these benefits. The prescriptive analysis is structured around key considerations that should be taken into account in using online experiments to study online behavior.},

@article{FrimpongAyaburiKofiAndohBaidoo2025,
 abstract = {Crowdfunding founders increasingly rely on reward-based platforms to raise capital for their projects. However, the low success rate of reward-based project campaigns remains a concern for many founders and platform managers. Prior studies investigating participants’ motivations have focused on either the founder or backer perspective, with little research examining the joint effects of founder and backer motivations. Drawing on the theory of basic human values, we assert that founders and backers are strategic about their motivations for engaging in crowdfunding campaigns. We identify four basic human values—self-transcendence, self-enhancement, openness to change, and conservation—that may reveal their intrinsic motivations and investigate how the degree of congruence between founders and backers on these values can influence campaign success. Using data from Kickstarter, we first extract evidence of these four values from the founder’s project description and backers’ comments for each project and empirically test a moderated model of reward-based crowdfunding success. The findings indicate that congruences in the openness to change, self-transcendence, and conservation values between founders and backers positively relate to project campaign success, but these relationships weaken when the congruence becomes excessive. However, self-enhancement value congruence between founders and backers can consistently maintain a stable positive influence on project campaign success. Furthermore, linguistic conformity is positively related to campaign success but reduces the distinctiveness of the congruence effects related to self-transcendence and openness to change. The study’s findings contribute to the value congruence literature and provide insights on how to improve the chances of project success in reward-based crowdfunding.},

 abstract = {Numerous studies have documented adverse consequences arising from increased technology usage and advocated for a reduction in such usage as a plausible remedy. However, such recommendations are often infeasible and oversimplistic given mounting evidence attesting to users’ growing reliance on technology in both their personal and professional lives. Building on conservation of resources (COR) theory, we construct a research model to explain how mobile application usage, as delineated by its breadth and depth, affects users’ nomophobia and sleep deprivation, which can have negative impacts on users’ health status. We also consider the moderating influence of physical activity in mitigating the effects of mobile application usage on users’ health. We validated our hypotheses via data collected by surveying 5,842 respondents. Empirical findings reveal that (1) nomophobia is positively influenced by mobile application usage breadth but negatively influenced by mobile application usage depth, (2) sleep deprivation is negatively influenced by mobile application usage breadth but positively influenced by mobile application usage depth, and (3) sleep deprivation and nomophobia negatively impact users’ health status, whereas (4) physical activity attenuates the impact of mobile application usage on sleep deprivation but not nomophobia. The findings from this study not only enrich the extant literature on the health outcomes of mobile application usage by unveiling the impact of mobile application usage patterns and physical activity on users’ health but they also inform practitioners on how calibrating usage breadth and depth, along with encouraging physical activity, can promote healthy habits among users.},

@article{FuFengYe2022,
 abstract = {Freelancers in online labor markets often display many skills in their profiles to increase their chances of being hired. However, such behavior may lead to the skills they display straddling multiple categories, that is, “skill spanning.” In this paper, we extend the concept of category spanning into online labor markets in the form of skill spanning and empirically examine (1) how freelancers’ skill spanning affects employers’ hiring decisions for two different types of jobs (low- and high-skill jobs, respectively), and (2) how freelancers’ skill matching moderates the effects of skill spanning on employers’ hiring decisions. Based on a unique dataset of 12,428 high-skill jobs and 19,875 low-skill jobs on a leading online labor platform, we find that freelancers’ skill spanning has different impacts on employers’ hiring decisions for these two job types. Specifically, for high-skill jobs, freelancers’ skill spanning reduces their likelihood of winning contracts; however, for low-skill jobs, freelancers’ skill spanning and their probabilities of winning contracts demonstrate an inverse U-shape relationship. Furthermore, freelancers’ skill matching can moderate the negative effects of skill spanning for high-skill jobs but not for low-skill jobs. Our findings provide guidelines for different stakeholders in online labor markets, including freelancers and platform owners.},

@article{GalBerenteChasin2022,
 abstract = {The technology lifecycle model is extensively used to study technology evolution and innovation. However, this model was developed for industrial-age material technologies and does not address digital technologies with nonmaterial elements. Therefore, a question emerges as to whether the level of technological materiality is implicated in different dynamics of innovation, as reflected in the technology lifecycle. Digital technologies evolve through discourse that involves interactions among multiple stakeholders that shape the evolutionary trajectory of the technology. Therefore, we set out to examine whether discourse about digital technologies that vary in their level of materiality manifests in different ways throughout these technologies’ lifecycles. To do so, we conducted a study comparing the discourse around 10 digital technologies—five highly material and five highly nonmaterial—at different stages of their technology lifecycles. We identified three characteristics of discourse—volume, volatility, and diversity—and examined them for the 10 digital technologies by analyzing their corresponding Wikipedia articles. Our findings show that the discourse around technologies with different levels of materiality is similar in the initial era of the lifecycle but diverges in the two subsequent eras. In addition, we found that the discourse around highly nonmaterial technologies remains elevated for longer time periods, compared to highly material technologies. Based on these results, we put forth propositions that challenge and extend existing research on the relationships between the technological level of materiality, discourse, and trajectories of technology evolution.},

@article{GalHansenLee2022,
 abstract = {Algorithmic decision-making systems (ADMS) are increasingly being used by public and private organizations to enact decisions traditionally made by human beings across a broad range of domains, including business, law enforcement, education, and healthcare. Their growing prevalence engenders profound ethical challenges, which, we maintain, should be examined in a structured and theoretically informed fashion. However, much of the ethical exploration of ADMS within the IS field draws upon an atheoretical application of ethics. In this paper, we argue that the “big three” ethical theories of consequentialism, deontology, and virtue ethics can inform a structured comparative analysis of the ethical significance of ADMS. We demonstrate the value of such an approach through an illustrative case study of an ADMS in use by an Australian bank. Building upon this analysis, we address four characteristics of ADMS from the three theoretical perspectives, provide guidance on the contexts within which the application of each theory might be particularly fruitful, and highlight the advantages of theoretically grounded ethical analyses of ADMS.},

@article{GhobadiSonenshein2024,
 abstract = {Social movement organizations (SMOs) have increasingly embraced digital activism, using social media and networking tools to advocate for a cause, to mobilize globally distributed consumers and pressure businesses to change their practices. Past research primarily focuses on how SMOs have used viral social media posts to prompt businesses to take immediate action on an issue. This article proposes a shift in the discourse to explore how SMOs’ digital activism can promote broader social change through collaborative agreements rather than merely demanding narrow concessions or compliance. We examine the online campaigns of a large international SMO and show how the campaigns influenced three global businesses to alter their environmental practices and industry standards. We find that the SMO used contrasting combinations of content positioning and social networking strategies to mobilize consumers, ultimately achieving collaboration agreements by influencing businesses’ risk perceptions and the potential strategic gains from collaboration with the SMO. The comparative analysis yields insights into how SMOs may vary their digital activism strategies depending on consumers’ loyalty to a business and its offerings, including its products and services. We develop a theoretical perspective that explains why and how consumer loyalty can shape SMOs’ selection of digital activism strategies and the process of achieving collaboration agreements. The findings also advance the literature on digital activism strategies by introducing the notion of ambivalent content positioning and emphasizing the significance of social networking for risk management and sustaining SMOs’ digital activism.},

@article{GierlichJoasBaiyereHess2024,
 abstract = {Digital workplace technologies lead to increasing levels of transparency. This, however, can invoke tensions: On the one hand, transparency facilitates employee empowerment, and on the other hand, transparency drives employee surveillance and privacy concerns. Furthermore, transparency has traditionally been one-sided, with control vested in managers, leading to a panoptical scenario. The contemporary workforce demands empowerment and bidirectional, inverse transparency, which challenges the assumptions of agency theory. These tensions are pertinent challenges that are even more salient today. Following a design science research process, we examine how a technical solution could be designed to mitigate these tensions and overcome the panopticon. Drawing on the knowledge base of stewardship theory and the concept of inverse transparency, we derive design requirements, design principles, and design features for an artifact that instantiates inverse transparency and drives the movement to stewardship behavior. We develop three theoretical conjectures on the artifact’s implications on kernel theory and conclude by advancing a design theory on inverse transparency that guides the design of digital workplace technologies. Lastly, our study illuminates the emerging understanding of transparency-related challenges in the contemporary workforce and further contributes to the discourse with theoretical and design knowledge.},

@article{GleasureConboyJiang2025,
 abstract = {The way we use technology both shapes and is shaped by our environment. These same technologies also shape and are shaped by our cognitive structures. While several existing theories explain individuals’ adaptations of technology, these theories typically focus on social and behavioral dynamics, with little attention on how technology adaptation changes individuals’ internal representations and associations. This is an important oversight to address, given that contemporary technologies such as social media, big data, artificial intelligence, and wearable devices are known to impact how we process information and conceptualize problems. In this study, we extend the adaptive theory of structuration for individuals (ASTI) to create a theory of technocognitive structuration. Technocognitive structuration proposes that exploitative and exploratory cognitive adaptations mediate how technology adaptations impact task adaptations. We tested this mediating effect using an online experiment, supported by a series of pilot studies and illustrations. The results support the proposed mediating role of cognitive adaptation. These findings challenge existing research on technology adaptation and suggest that not only is cognitive adaptation an important phenomenon to study in its own right but it may also be an important element to consider when making causal claims about other outcomes linked with technology adaptation.},

@article{GongCheungZhangEtAl2021a,
 abstract = {Obsessive online social gaming has become a worldwide societal challenge that deserves more scholarly investigation. However, this issue has not received much attention in the information systems (IS) research community. Guided by dual-system theory, we theoretically derive a typology of obsessive technology use and contextually adapt it to conceptualize obsessive online social gaming. We also build upon identity theory to develop a dual-identity perspective (i.e., IT identity and social identity) of obsessive online social gaming. We test our research model using a longitudinal survey of 627 online social game users. Our results demonstrate that the typology of obsessive technology use comprises four interrelated types: impulsive use, compulsive use, excessive use, and addictive use. IT identity positively affects the four obsessive online social gaming archetypes and fully mediates the effect of social identity on obsessive online social gaming. The results also show that IT identity is predicted by embeddedness, self-efficacy, and instant gratification, whereas social identity is determined by group similarity, group familiarity, and intragroup communication. Our study contributes to the IS literature by proposing a typology of obsessive technology use, incorporating identity theory to provide a contextualized explanation of obsessive online social gaming and offering implications for addressing the societal challenge.},

@article{GonzalezDeng2023,
 abstract = {Social inclusion has become a pressing issue for organizations wishing to close the inequality and disparity gaps associated with underrepresented or disadvantaged groups. The challenge is becoming particularly critical in higher education institutions suffering from low retention rates and low graduation rates among first-generation college students (FGCS). In response to the challenges imposed by the notion of social inclusion, some universities and colleges are exploring the use of social networking technologies such as social media (SM) in ways that can impact social inclusion. In order to improve the understanding of how social networking technology affects the social inclusion of FGCS, we conducted a case study in a public, Hispanic-serving institution in the United States. We used technology affordance theory to reveal various affordances actualized by FGCS and various outcomes resulting from those affordances. To explain how the actualization of different strands of affordance produces certain outcomes, our analysis of 102 FGCS’ narratives followed an established five-step framework for identifying generative mechanisms, revealing three SM user types—Community Builders, Scholars, and Information Seekers—and four actualized affordances, namely interconnection, inspiration, insightfulness, and intense comfort, which are conceptualized into three generative mechanisms: identity booster, academic growth, and self-care. Our results provide insights into SM usage for social inclusion outcomes. By revealing how technology use can promote social engagement and mitigate exclusion experienced by FGCS, this study contributes to the broad social inclusion research on technology and disadvantaged communities.},

 abstract = {Advances in reinforcement learning and implicit data collection on large-scale commercial platforms mark the beginning of a new era of personalization aimed at the adaptive control of human user environments. We present five emergent features of this new paradigm of personalization that endanger persons and societies at scale and analyze their potential to reduce personal autonomy, destabilize social and political systems, and facilitate mass surveillance and social control, among other concerns. We argue that current data protection laws, most notably the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, are limited in their ability to adequately address many of these issues. Nevertheless, we believe that IS researchers are well-situated to engage with and investigate this new era of personalization. We propose three distinct directions for ethically aware reinforcement learning-based personalization research uniquely suited to the strengths of IS researchers across the sociotechnical spectrum.},

@article{Gregor2024,
 abstract = {The aim of this opinion piece is to examine the responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI) in relation to academic journal publishing. The work discusses approaches to AI with particular attention to recent developments with generative AI. Consensus is noted around eight normative themes for principles for responsible AI and their associated risks. A framework from Shneiderman (2022) for human-centered AI is employed to consider journal publishing practices that can address the principles of responsible AI at different levels. The resultant AI principled governance matrix (AI-PGM) for journal publishing shows how countermeasures for risks can be employed at the levels of the author-researcher team, the organization, the industry, and by government regulation. The AI-PGM allows a structured approach to responsible AI and may be modified as developments with AI unfold. It shows how the whole publishing ecosystem should be considered when looking at the responsible use of AI—not just journal policy itself.},

@article{GregoryHenfridsson2021a,
 abstract = {We present a model of phenomenon-driven theorizing that may guide researchers in bridging art and science as they engage in pure theory development. The model seeks to leverage activities related to discovery and prescience (conceiving the theory), imagination and logic (constructing the theory), as well as storytelling and scripting (communicating the theory). We illustrate the model through a reflective inquiry into our recent work on data network effects. The model represents a balanced take on theory development and is useful for tempering the natural tendency in academia to drift toward the science of theorizing at the expense of the art of theorizing.},

 abstract = {Research in information systems (IS) is often challenged during the review process with “what’s new” and the “so what” questions. While we believe that there is innovation in IS research, constituents in the field do not have a good or at least consistent understanding of what this entails. This creates a problem for editors, authors, and reviewers in assessing how innovative a study is or what aspects of the work are indeed innovative. This paper is a response to this concern that takes on the challenging task of recognizing innovation in IS research. At the most basic level, we offer a structure that examines a variety of ways that innovation may be manifested in our research output. We describe, illustrate, and discuss the challenges of using our categories of innovative research. We hope that such identification can stimulate and expand our capacity to generate innovative research and to recognize (and promote) it when it is forthcoming.},

 abstract = {This paper proposes a method for the sign prediction of ties in social networks using a design science research process. The proposed method is grounded in social network analysis and leverages the tenets of graph augmentation and a graph regularized framework for information diffusion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that develops a sign prediction method for social networks based on the principles of design science research. This study makes several contributions. We demonstrate the utility and applicability of the proposed method for predicting trust/distrust on a user-user network created from the IMDb platform, which represents ties between reviewers based on their movie evaluation preferences. We describe and discuss the novel aspects of graph augmentation, symmetric normalization of the affinity matrix, and graph regularized label propagation, and discuss their synergistic use to predict the signs of network ties. We also establish the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing its performance with two different metrics for balanced networks and two metrics for unbalanced networks using four state-of-the-art methods. The benchmarking networks used for experiments originate from online platforms such as Slashdot, Epinions, Wikipedia, and the Yeast Genetic Interaction Network from the biology domain. Experiments show that the proposed method provides significant performance improvements in the sign prediction of ties in social networks. This study provides valuable insights for social media platform owners seeking to improve their platforms by building new features and business leaders seeking to target advertisements and personalized content to users. We also discuss the theoretical, practical, and societal implications of this research.},

 abstract = {The conceptualization of space is integral to many of the diverse forms of information systems—for example, the physical space represented in geographical information systems and the virtual space of simulated worlds. Yet despite its importance and centrality, the conceptualization of space in information systems is not as sophisticated or mature as in other fields. A lack of attention to the diversity of perspectives on space hampers ongoing research and the re-visioning of phenomena that could lead to new insights in information systems. The aim of this paper is to develop an encompassing framework that provides a comprehensive view of philosophical perspectives, spatial themes, and concepts of space that are relevant to information systems. As a result of an extensive literature review, an encompassing framework is presented that includes four prominent spatial themes: representing space, differentiating space, disclosing space, and intuitive space. Each theme is related to its key characteristics and features and underlying philosophical perspectives. The paper demonstrates how the new framework can facilitate IS scholars’ expansive analysis in scholarly work and assist editors and reviewers in evaluating papers concerning space in IS and shows how the re-visioning of phenomena can lead to transformational shifts in understanding IS phenomena.},

@article{HakiLegner2021a,
 abstract = {Inspired by the city planning metaphor, enterprise architecture (EA) has gained considerable attention from academia and industry for systematically planning an IT landscape. Since EA is a relatively young discipline, a great deal of its work focuses on architecture representations (descriptive EA) that conceptualize the different architecture layers, their components, and relationships. Beyond architecture representations, EA should comprise principles that guide architecture design and evolution toward predefined value and outcomes (prescriptive EA). However, research on EA principles is still very limited. Notwithstanding the increasing consensus regarding the role and definition of EA principles, the limited publications neither discuss what can be considered suitable principles nor explain how they can be turned into effective means to achieve expected EA outcomes. This study seeks to strengthen the extant theoretical core of EA by investigating EA principles through a mixed methods research design comprising a literature review, an expert study, and three case studies. The first contribution of this study is that it sheds light on the ambiguous interpretation of EA principles in the extant research by ontologically distinguishing between principles and nonprinciples, as well as deriving a set of suitable EA (meta)principles. The second contribution connects the nascent academic discourse on EA principles to studies on EA value and outcomes. This study conceptualizes the “mechanics” of EA principles as a value-creation process, where EA principles shape architecture design and guide its evolution and thereby realize EA outcomes. Consequently, this study brings the underserved, prescriptive aspect of EA to the fore and helps enrich its theoretical foundations.},

@article{HarmonWalden2021a,
 abstract = {The information technology (IT) field faces a skills shortage. Only 17% of a projected 3.5 million computing job openings are expected to be filled by 2026 (National Association for Women & Information Technology, 2018). Yet the number of women pursuing IT careers continues to decrease—only 19% of IT bachelor’s degrees in 2016 were awarded to women compared to 57% of bachelor’s degrees overall. We compared three theories that could explain this gender gap in the pursuit of IT careers: expectancy-value theory, role congruity theory, and field-specific ability beliefs theory. We find that women and men are similar in their levels of important factors related to career interest, but that two of these factors—technical learning self-efficacy and agentic goals—have increased salience for women. This suggests that some of the gender gap in the IT field could be addressed by placing more focus on developing technical learning self-efficacy in both men and women. While this could help both women and men, it would likely have an outsized effect on the IT career pursuit of women.},

 abstract = {Civic crowdfunding is a subgenre of crowdfunding wherein the crowd finances civic projects of value to communities. A unique aspect of civic crowdfunding is that projects regularly attract a mix of individuals and organizations, spanning the private, public, and nonprofit sectors. This diversity of stakeholders raises novel questions and challenges for platform operators and fundraisers. Here, we focus on such challenges as they relate to third-party endorsements. A lengthy literature has examined the signaling value of endorsements and prominent lead contributions, typically treating their sources as homogeneous. However, the varied backgrounds, motivations, and objectives of stakeholders in civic crowdfunding suggest that endorsers’ signaling value is likely to vary. We theorize how onlookers’ (potential backers’ or donors’) perception of lead organizational donors’ motivations and fit with the project’s objectives will influence the latter’s signaling value, hypothesizing differences across lead donor types (i.e., businesses, governments, nongovernmental organizations [NGOs]). Leveraging data on 303 projects from a leading civic crowdfunding platform, Spacehive, we show that lead donations are significantly more beneficial when supplied by NGOs rather than businesses or government entities. Further, based on perceptual measures reported by human coders about the more than 500 organizational lead donations in our sample, we confirm our theorized mechanisms, finding that lead donor involvement is more likely to be perceived as credible, and to lead to support for a project, when the lead’s involvement is believed to be a result of value motives (rather than strategic motives), and when the lead is a natural fit with the project (i.e., congruence). We discuss the implications of our work for both theory and practice.},

@article{HolotiukBeimbornHund2024a,
 abstract = {Digital transformation alters companies’ core value-defining activities. Companies must establish new work practices and change the work environment to create new value propositions leveraging digital technologies. Specifically, to maximize their investments in digital transformation while remaining competitive, they must achieve ambidexterity, which is the capability to balance exploration and exploitation flexibly. More and more companies strive to achieve ambidexterity by establishing digital innovation labs (DILs), where employees explore the opportunities afforded through digital technologies and ensure their successful integration into the main organization. This study analyzes data collected from nine DILs, examining how companies utilize them to achieve organizational ambidexterity. Our analysis reveals a nuanced view on the conceptualization of ambidexterity and how it helps in digital transformation: (1) DILs contribute mainly by transferring employees temporarily from the main organization to the DIL and back. Recombining mechanisms of different theoretical forms of ambidexterity addresses typical issues and tensions stemming from leveraging digital technologies in innovation activities. (2) We find that implementing ambidexterity through organizational design features of DILs provides a successful basis for digital transformation by creating innovations that complement companies’ value propositions with digital technologies.},

 abstract = {In this study, we investigate whether and to what extent community managers in online collaborative communities can stimulate community activities through their engagement. Using a novel data set of 22 large online idea crowdsourcing campaigns, we find that moderate but steady manager activities are adequate to enhance community participation. Moreover, we show that appreciation, motivation, and intellectual stimulation by community managers are positively associated with community participation but that the effectiveness of these communication strategies depends on the form of participation managers wish to encourage. Finally, the data reveal that community manager activities requiring more effort, such as media file uploads vs. simple written comments, have a stronger effect on community participation.},

@article{HovorkaPeter2021a,
 abstract = {Our ability to predict, explain, or control sociotechnical realities is being increasingly called into question by unprecedented phenomena in surveillance, in markets, and in other social and political domains. The apparatus of research - our current categories, instruments, arguments, and epistemic choices - rely on what is empirically accessible, i.e., on the past. Our research orientation toward the future assumes continuity and the extension of past patterns into a predictable and thus manageable future. In this research, we propose speculative engagement through digital geographies to make visible the processes of technological and cultural reconfiguration that result in unprecedented change. After describing the conception of “the future” in widely used research methods, we describe speculative engagement as a research orientation to disclose new categories, relationships, and values and a commitment to the performative relationships of our current research practices with potential future(s). Digital geographies are internally consistent and coherent worlds that are cognitively plausible but estranging. They are carriers of meaning and culture that underpin a broad class of methods to provide richly experienced “other worlds.” We posit principles for effective digital geographies and provide an illustrative example of a digital human artifact that estranges us from current assumptions. Finally, we argue that our approach enables researchers to engage with the future on its own terms. In this way, researchers, designers, and policy makers can open current practices to new categories, relationships, logics, and values and make visible the unprecedented reconfigurations in which our research is implicated.},

@article{HuangJinHuang2021a,
 abstract = {Online review platforms have become very popular in recent years, generating massive numbers of online reviews and thus enticing numerous enterprises to respond to reviews. Although the economic impact (e.g., sales impact) of managerial responses is well recognized, it is unclear whether such an impact is moderated by competitive intensity and market position. This study examines the moderating effects of competitive intensity and market position in the relationship between managerial responses and sales. Using a panel dataset from one of the largest restaurant review platforms in China, this research found that the influence of the volume of managerial responses to positive word-of-mouth (WOM) on sales declined with increasing competitive intensity and decreasing market position. Moreover, we found the volume and degree of personalization of managerial responses to negative WOM to be more important for enterprises with a low market position versus those with a high market position. Our results provide insights into the effectiveness of managerial responses in different environments. We also offer managerial implications to service providers on response strategies.},

@article{HuWangLiang2023,
 abstract = {Literature has shown that business-information technology (IT) alignment can exert both positive and negative influences on organizational agility, giving rise to the IT alignment-agility paradox. To better understand this paradox at a more granular level, we conceptualize the sensing and responding dimensions of organizational agility as two independent constructs and suggest a nonlinear analytical approach. Based on configurational and contextual perspectives, this study investigates how intellectual and social alignment and organizational and environmental elements combine into multiple configurations to affect sensing and responding capabilities. Fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) is used to analyze the survey data from 135 dyads of business and IT executives from the Chinese shipbuilding industry. Results show that different equifinal pathways can be used to achieve high sensing and responding capabilities, in which intellectual and social alignment play heterogeneous roles depending on the specific contexts. This study extends the ITenabled agility literature by deepening our understanding of the effects of multidimensional IT alignment on multidimensional organizational agility and providing new insights into the IT alignment-agility paradox.},

 abstract = {This study aims to contribute to the literature on knowledge management systems (KMS) through investigating the role of engagement as an important intermediary in the relationship between KMS use and outcomes. Building on prior literature, we propose a theoretical model that conceptualizes KMS use as a valuable resource and distinguish between two types of cognitive engagement: professional cognitive engagement and organizational cognitive engagement. These, in turn, mediate the KMS use-job performance and KMS use-organizational commitment relationships. We tested the model on a sample of 3354 real estate agents using an extensive dataset comprised of primary and secondary data. The findings show that KMS use has an impact on individuals’ professional and organizational cognitive engagement, which then impacts their job performance and organizational commitment. However, our findings indicate that professional cognitive engagement only partially mediates the relationship between KMS use and job performance. We conclude the paper with a discussion of theoretical contributions and practical implications.},

@article{JabbariReckerGreenEtAl2022,
 abstract = {Because most real-world domains intended to be supported by an information system are complex, practitioners often use multiple different types of conceptual modeling scripts to understand them. We performed two experiments to examine how two theoretical factors of multiple scripts— combined ontological completeness and ontological overlap—influence how users develop an understanding of a real-world domain from multiple scripts. Results of the first experiment show that to some degree, ontological overlap improves participants’ understanding of a domain, more so than combined ontological completeness. In the second experiment, we tracked the eye movement data of participants to understand how ontological overlap between scripts impacts users’ information search and cognitive integration processes. We found that some occurrence of semantically similar constructs between scripts helps individuals to identify and relate constructs presented in different scripts. Users, therefore, can identify and focus on script areas that are relevant to their problem tasks. However, a high level of ontological overlap decreases the attention paid by participants to relevant task-specific areas because they spend more time searching for relevant information. Together, our findings both refine and extend existing conceptual modeling theory. We clarify the dialectics between the full and parsimonious real-world representations offered through multiple scripts and the individual’s understanding of the domain that is represented by those scripts.},

 abstract = {The aim of fitness technologies, a combination of wearables and associated applications, is to support users’ health and fitness regimes. The market for fitness technologies continues to increase, and the technologies themselves are quickly advancing. However, it is unclear how effective fitness technologies are in generating wellness outcomes, and there is concern regarding frequent discontinuance behaviors. Accordingly, we develop a model to explain how the perception that fitness technologies satisfy or frustrate users’ basic psychological needs (BPNs) in exercise mediates the relationships between the users’ goals for fitness technology use and psychological well-being and continuance. We find that users who start using fitness technologies for enjoyment, challenge, revitalization, affiliation, or to make positive improvements to their health or strength and endurance, are more likely to report that the fitness technologies are satisfying their BPNs, whereas users who start using them for stress management, social recognition, competition, or weight management are more likely to report BPNs frustration. Notably, users who start using fitness technologies for enjoyment and to make positive improvements to their health or strength and endurance are less likely to report BPNs frustration, and use driven by social recognition goals can decrease BPNs satisfaction. BPNs satisfaction is associated with both increased psychological well-being and continuance, whereas BPNs frustration is negatively associated with both. Fitness technologies must thus be perceived by users to satisfy their BPNs (i.e., autonomy, competence, and relatedness) in exercise to ensure positive outcomes from use.},

@article{JarvelainenNiemimaaZimmer2022,
 abstract = {Business continuity (BC) management is an organizational approach to preparing information systems (IS) for incidents, but such approaches are uncommon among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Past research has indicated a gap in approaches that are designed for SMEs since BC management approaches tend to originate from larger organizations and SMEs lack the resources to implement them. To fill this gap, and to respond to a practical need by an IT consultancy company, we employed design science research (DSR) to develop a BC approach for SMEs coined as the thrifty BC management approach. Jointly with the company’s practitioners, we developed a set of meta-requirements for BC approaches for SMEs anchored in prior BC literature, practitioners’ practical expertise, and the theories of collective mindfulness and sociotechnical systems. We evaluated our thrifty BC management approach with multiple SMEs. These evaluations suggest that the designed approach mostly meets the defined meta-requirements. Moreover, the evaluations offered ample opportunities for learning. The design process, unfolding in a real-world setting, was precarious, rife with contingencies and ad hoc decisions. To render the design process transparent, we adapted four writing conventions from the confessional research genre familiar to ethnographic research but novel to DSR. We offer a threefold contribution. First, we contribute to SMEs’ BC with meta-requirements and their instantiation in a new BC approach (artifact); second, we contribute with four practices of confessional writing for transparency of DSR research; and third, we contribute with reflections on our theoretical learning from throughout the design process.},

 abstract = {The Journal of the Association for Information Systems has long had a reputation for promoting theory development. Yet theory development can be experienced as risky and frustrating because of a lack of divergence and convergence—both in terms of ideas and in the social dynamics among human theorists. These dichotomies can stymie progress and lead to unfinished works. Misconceptions about theory can also hamper advances. We examine the ways in which generative artificial intelligence (gAI) tools may be useful in developing theory in information systems (IS) through human-gAI collaboration, thus forging new frontiers in IS theorizing.},

@article{JiangWagnerChen2021a,
 abstract = {Microtask crowdsourcing platforms foster digital assembly lines where microtasks are performed by on-demand microworkers. The sustainability of microtask crowdsourcing platforms and the timely completion of microtask batches hinge on microworkers’ continued participation, but our understanding of microworkers’ continuance remains unclear. Drawing on the theory of the allocation of time and the research on work motivational orientations, we hypothesize that three motivational orientations (i.e., compensation, enjoyment, and microtime structure) are positively associated with microworkers’ perceived relative advantage of microworking, which in turn enhances microworkers’ intent to continue microworking. The relationships between the three motivational orientations and relative advantage are moderated by microworkers’ perceived situational boredom and microwork status (i.e., ad hoc, part-time, and full-time). An online survey on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk provides empirical evidence for the predictive powers, which are contingent on situational boredom, of the three motivational orientations on relative advantage, suggesting that fine-grained microtasks cater to the inherent desire to structure time at a microlevel. We further found that the relationships between motivational orientations and relative advantage differ across ad hoc, part-time, and full-time microworkers. Our study sheds light on theorizing users’ participation by incorporating the time lens and distinguishing heterogeneous effects across temporal contexts and user types. Our findings also provide important practical implications for the design and organization of microwork as well as the governance of the crowdsourcing platform.},

 abstract = {While the literature has reached a consensus on the awareness effect of online word-of-mouth (eWOM), this paper studies its persuasive effect—specifically, dimension-specific sentiment effects on product sales.We examine the sentiment information in eWOM along different product dimensions and reveal different persuasive effects on consumers’ purchase decisions based on consumers’ sentiment preference, which is defined as the relative importance that consumers place on various dimension-specific sentiments. We use an aspect-level sentiment analysis to derive dimension-specific sentiment and PVAR (panel vector auto-regression) models, and estimate their effects on product sales using a movie panel dataset. The findings show that three dimension-specific sentiments (star, genre, and plot) are positively related to movie sales.Regarding consumers’ sentiment preferences, we find a positive relationship to movie sales that is stronger for plot sentiment, relative to star sentiment for low-budget movies. For high-budget movies, we find a positive relationship to movie sales that is stronger for star sentiment, relative to plot or genre sentiment.},

 abstract = {Digital transformation is often described as organizational change that is simultaneously triggered and enabled by digital technologies. As with other types of organizational transformation, overcoming organizational inertia lies at the heart of digital transformation. However, our understanding of the specific processes employed by incumbent firms to overcome organizational inertia in digital transformation is currently limited. In this paper, we draw on the case study of AsiaBank, a large traditional bank in Asia, to explore the microfoundations of how incumbent firms tackle different types of inertia as they embark on a digital transformation journey. We identify four key digital transformation processes—i.e., embracing the consumerization of digital technologies, diffusing and appropriating digital business practices, enabling distributed organizing, and revamping IT architecture—that combine to reduce negative psychology, sociocognitive, sociotechnical, political, and economic inertia in digital transformation. Our findings expand the extant view on the role of agency in overcoming organizational inertia and contribute to the literature at the intersection of digital innovation and transformation.},

@article{Kankanhalli2024,
 abstract = {Rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI), including recent generative forms, are significantly impacting our lives and work. A key aspect of our work as IS researchers is the publishing of research articles, for which peer review serves as the primary means of quality control. While there have been debates about whether and to what extent AI can replace researchers in various domains, including IS, we lack an in-depth understanding of how AI can impact the peer review process. Considering the high volume of submissions and limited reviewer resources, there is a pressing need to use AI to augment the review process. At the same time, advances in AI have been accompanied by concerns about biases introduced by AI tools and the ethics of using them, among other issues such as hallucinations. Thus, critical issues to understand are: how can AI augment and potentially automate the review process, what are the pitfalls in doing so, and what er the implications for IS research and peer review practice. I will offer my views on these issues in this opinion piece.},

 abstract = {Although attractive to foreign and domestic firms, bottom-of-pyramid (BOP) markets pose unique challenges. Research suggests that IT-enabled supply chain information integration (IT-SCII) helps firms collaborate with suppliers and clients in broad business activities, operate in a unique context, and overcome salient challenges in BOP markets. Anecdotal evidence and research suggest that foreign and domestic firms have differing advantages: While foreign firms have considerable global experience, domestic firms have substantial local market knowledge. We draw on the ownership-location-internalization (OLI) framework to theorize that domestic and foreign firms leverage IT-SCII differently because of their differing ownership-based advantages in BOP markets. We hypothesize that the influence of IT-SCII on client business collaboration and the influence of client business collaboration on firm performance are stronger for domestic firms than for foreign firms. Conversely, we hypothesize that the influence of IT-SCII on supplier business collaboration and the influence of supplier business collaboration on firm performance are stronger for foreign firms than for domestic firms. We test our hypotheses in the automotive parts manufacturing BOP market comprising foreign and domestic firms in India. Partial least squares and econometric analyses of 172 firms reveal broad support for our hypotheses. By incorporating the OLI framework into IT-enabled supply chain literature, our study contributes to theory and practice by highlighting that IT-SCII has differing implications for foreign and domestic firms in BOP markets.},

@article{KimBenbasat2024a,
 abstract = {With more online stores providing recommendations and reviews simultaneously from multiple advice sources—such as recommendation agents, other consumers, and experts—consumers are facing the challenge of deciding how to use wide-ranging and possibly conflicting sets of information to improve their product selection. Although previous studies have investigated the classical decision-making strategies used in preferential choice problems, most of these are not directly applicable to multiple advice source environments. In addition, since most of these studies have mainly focused on a variance model rather than a process model, they cannot fully explain how decision makers reach their product selection decisions. To shed light on the processes that online consumers use in making product selections when using multiple advice sources, this study: (1) explores if, how, and when consumers use consistency as a part of their decision-making strategies through developing process models; (2) identifies the consistency strategies utilized when using multiple advice sources; and (3) proposes a new consistency-based decision-making model. Through concurrent verbal protocol analysis, we identified four consistency strategies and found that the use of consistency strategies increases decision quality more than traditional nonconsistency strategies. Our findings are triangulated through the theoretical lens of cognitive dissonance theory, information search process model, and confirmation bias for rigorous validation. We also describe the theoretical and practical implications of our findings.},

 abstract = {Cloud computing separates service users from carbon emission sources, obscuring IT’s ecological responsibility across national boundaries. This study dissects the digital responsibility of cloud computing, with a focus on obligations and accountability, to address its impact on the environment. To identify direct emitters and beneficiaries of pollution resulting from cloud computing and define the associated obligations, we estimate how cloud computing alters the energy and carbon intensities of IT capital and services in cloud region countries hosting data centers, as well as in neighboring countries. Using country-level data on IT capital stock and IT service expenditures for 51 countries from 1995 to 2016, combined with data on geographical proximity to cloud regions of global public cloud services, our results show that in cloud region countries, the environmental benefits of cloud-based IT services come at the expense of increased energy and carbon intensities from the IT capital providing those services. Conversely, neighboring countries seem to benefit from cloud services that generate pollution in cloud region countries, as evidenced by lower energy and carbon intensities in cloud-based IT services, without compromising their own environmental performance. Our findings suggest that both cloud service hosting and using countries share obligations for the environmental impacts of cloud computing. Building on our empirical findings, we discuss implications for accountability in cloud computing to facilitate the fulfillment of these obligations. We propose a shared responsibility model that allocates accountability between service providers and users, advancing the discourse on cloud computing responsibility and outlining directions for future research.},

@article{KnoteJansonSollnerEtAl2021a,
 abstract = {In the realm of smart services, smart personal assistants (SPAs) have become a popular medium for value co-creation between service providers and users. The market success of SPAs is largely based on their innovative material properties, such as natural language user interfaces, machine learning-powered request handling and service provision, and anthropomorphism. In different combinations, these properties offer users entirely new ways to intuitively and interactively achieve their goals and thus co-create value with service providers. But how does the nature of the SPA shape value co-creation processes? In this paper, we look through a functional affordances lens to theorize about the effects of different types of SPAs (i.e., with different combinations of material properties) on users’ value co-creation processes. Specifically, we collected SPAs from research and practice by reviewing scientific literature and web resources, developed a taxonomy of SPAs’ material properties, and performed a cluster analysis to group SPAs of a similar nature. We then derived 2 general and 11 cluster-specific propositions on how different material properties of SPAs can yield different affordances for value co-creation. With our work, we point out that smart services require researchers and practitioners to fundamentally rethink value co-creation as well as revise affordances theory to address the dynamic nature of smart technology as a service counterpart.},

By systematically reviewing the Green IT and Green IS literatures, we show that the IS field has lagged behind current discourse in practice and therefore lacks the conceptualization of the relationships between digital technologies and sustainability. Digital sustainability is defined in this editorial as the development and deployment of digital resources and artifacts toward improving the environment, society, and economic welfare. We hope that this editorial motivates IS researchers to engage in digital sustainability as an emerging research area.},

@article{KrancherOshriKotlarskyEtAl2022,
 abstract = {While multisourcing offers benefits such as access to best-of-breed resources and enhanced competition, it also presents clients with a new governance challenge, namely the need to ensure that vendors not only deliver their individual contributions but also collaborate to produce a coherent joint outcome. Clients can address this challenge by combining bilateral governance focused on each vendor’s individual performance with collective governance aimed at the vendors’ joint performance. However, it is unclear how the simultaneous application of bilateral and collective governance affects multisourcing performance. Indeed, the literature falls short in systematically differentiating these governance mechanisms and empirically examining their interplay. Drawing on existing work on multisourcing and on the outsourcing governance literature, we argue that bilateral and collective governance direct efforts toward different performance dimensions (individual vs. joint), invoke different metaphors (market vs. team), and promote conflicting norms (competitive vs. cooperative), which can result in trade-offs when bilateral and collective governance mechanisms are combined. Results from a survey of 189 multisourcing arrangements support our expectation that bilateral and collective governance promote different performance dimensions. Notably, one collective governance mechanism, conflict management procedures, contributes to both individual and joint performance. We find substitutional effects between bilateral and collective governance in relation to joint performance but not individual performance, indicating that the benefits of collective governance for joint performance are more easily compromised than the benefits of bilateral governance for individual performance. We also observe complementary effects within collective governance mechanisms. Our key contribution lies in theorizing and empirically examining the effects and interplay of bilateral and collective governance in multisourcing.},

@article{KrepsRowe2024,
 abstract = {What if reality fundamentally consists in events and processes rather than things? All actions are situated within processes, influenced by a broader set of preceding and concomitant flows of digital information and other actions. This paper offers a process philosophy perspective that sees things as merely constellations of processes. Decisions within these processes, moreover, must usually be made within time constraints. Rather than a view of time, such as in process theories, as being tied to notions of entities, variance, or—at best—the flow of things, process philosophy sees time as duration: tied to consciousness, sensemaking, and free will. While principles for conducting positivist, interpretive, and critical research have been widely discussed in the IS literature, criteria and principles for a process philosophy perspective are lacking. In the context of Bergson and Whitehead’s creative evolution process philosophy, this paper proposes a set of five principles for the conduct of process philosophy research in information systems: (1) heterogeneous multiplicity, (2) immanence in a process, (3) experience over abstraction, (4) consciousness in duration, and (5) a relational ontology. We describe these in detail and discuss some potential applications, methodological issues, and related difficulties in the principles’ implementation for IS research. We highlight their value for requirements engineering in large-scale projects.},

@article{KrusePuraoSeidel2022,
 abstract = {This paper investigates how information systems design professionals use design principles (extracted from a prior design science research project) in a new design situation. We do this by capturing think-aloud protocols from experienced design professionals who are given access to potentially useful design principles. Our analysis identifies two dimensions of use: design behaviors (what designers do) and application modes (how designers apply the principles). Mapping across the dimensions suggests two use pathways: forward chaining and backward chaining. Our study shows how empirically studying expert designers can shed light on the microprocesses of design principles in use, and how an empirical turn in the investigation can contribute to clarifying the fundamental nature of design principles. We conclude by highlighting the implications of these insights for crafting more useful design principles.},

@article{KummerMendling2021a,
 abstract = {The operational management of risk and internal controls (RIC) makes increasing use of visual representations to support tasks such as risk assessment and control activity definition. The strengths and weaknesses of different representations are typically assessed by cognitive theories that assume an analytical and an intuitive mode of information processing. Previous research has focused mainly on the analytical risk assessment while intuitive information processing has largely been neglected. We develop a theoretical argument based on dual-process theory, which explains why RIC representational alternatives influence different levels of information processing. We test our hypotheses with the help of an online experiment using accountants and operation managers recruited via MTurk (N = 166). Our results suggest that highlighting risk and controls in business process modeling and notation (BPMN) by using color improves risk understanding, control understanding, and the identification of control improvements, which help reduce the risk in a given process. Furthermore, we do not find evidence that the inclusion of color leads to perception biases. This has implications for information systems research, which has primarily addressed the analytical processing of conceptual models. Our findings extend cognitive research on such models by adding an intuitive processing path that can improve the user’s risk management performance. For practitioners, our findings are particularly relevant because colors can be easily added as a secondary notation element without disguising the factual risk situation in processes.},

@article{LeeParkZaggl2022,
 abstract = {Online collaboration communities are increasingly taking on new roles beyond knowledge creation and exchange, especially the role of a skill-signaling channel for career-motivated community members. This paper examines the contingency effects of job-market conditions for career-motivated knowledge contributions in online collaboration communities. From the data of individual-level activities in a computer programming-related online Q&A community (Stack Overflow), merged with job-market data for software developers, we find robust evidence of a positive association between community members’ career motivations and their knowledge contributions. More importantly, we find that this positive relationship is strengthened by job-market conditions: the number of vacancies in the job market, the expected salaries from these jobs, and the transparency in the flow of career-related information between the community and external recruiters. We contribute to the motivation literature in online collaboration communities by identifying and substantiating the role of contextual factors in mobilizing members’ career motivation. Our study thus offers novel insight into how career motivation can be effectively utilized to motivate contributors in these communities. Our findings also point to a possible paradigm change by characterizing online collaboration communities as emerging institutions for career motivation and skill signaling.},

We develop and explain by example a model of theorizing for developing new theories. The model comprises theory genesis, four thought-gears—namely Informing Thoughts, Generating Thoughts, Materializing Thoughts, and Building Theory Elements from Thoughts—culminating in theory composition. While the theorizing model was developed based on our experience creating grand theory, we believe it can be applied to the development of other forms of theory.},

@article{LeiYinZhang2023b,
 abstract = {How and why positive and negative reviews influence product sales differently has critical implications for both research and businesses. Although earlier online word-of-mouth research empirically documented that negative reviews influence product sales to a greater extent than positive reviews (i.e., a negativity bias), later research has revealed that positive reviews are generally more helpful (i.e., a positivity bias). We propose that an answer to this conundrum may be that negative reviews get more exposure than positive reviews. As consumers are often overwhelmed by the massive number of online reviews, they need to be selective when searching for reviews. This research investigates consumers’ preference for positive vs. negative reviews during both the information-seeking and information-evaluation stages of their decision-making process. Drawing on the motivated reasoning literature, we propose that consumers exhibit a negativity bias when they search for reviews to read but manifest a confirmation bias when they evaluate the helpfulness of reviews. We conducted three experiments and found consistent support for these hypotheses. Our findings expand the current understanding of consumers’ processing of online reviews to the information-seeking stage, reveal differential biases at different stages, demonstrate a possible explanation for the negativity bias in product sales, and provide important practical implications.},

 abstract = {Although collective trolling poses a growing threat to both individuals and virtual community owners, the information systems (IS) literature lacks a rich theorization of this phenomenon. To address the research gaps, we introduce the concept of we-intention to capture the collective nature of collective trolling in virtual communities. We also integrate the social identity model of deindividuation effects (SIDE) and situational action theory to invoke the sociotechnical perspective in theorizing collective trolling in virtual communities. The objective of this study is to use the sociotechnical perspective to understand the we-intention to participate in collective trolling in virtual communities. We test our proposed model using data gathered from 377 Reddit users. Our moderated mediation analysis elaborates how technical elements (i.e., anonymity of self and anonymity of others) influence the we-intention to participate in collective trolling via individual-based social elements (i.e., perceived online disinhibition and social identity), with an environment-based social element (i.e., the absence of capable guardianship) as a boundary condition. We contribute to research by explaining collective trolling in virtual communities from the group-referent intentional action perspective and sociotechnical perspective. We also offer practical insights into ways to combat collective trolling in virtual communities.},

@article{LiCheungShenEtAl2024,
 abstract = {Doxing on social networking sites (SNS doxing) has attracted scholarly and public attention due to the devastating consequences that this behavior can have on individuals and society. SNS doxing occurs when netizens disclose wrongdoers’ personal information on SNSs to punish them and hold them accountable for their unethical and improper acts. To offer a compelling theoretical explanation for this behavior beyond descriptive analyses of SNS doxing, we extend the social cognitive theory of moral thought and action by using retributive proportionality and social approval to articulate doxers’ moral judgments and decision-making. We conducted two independent studies using scenario-based and field surveys to validate the research model. The results of polynomial regression analysis suggest that users’ moral approval of SNS doxing is the result of the combined analyses between perceived blameworthiness of the doxee, perceived severity of SNS doxing, and perceived social approval of SNS doxing. We also found that users’ moral approval of SNS doxing determines their engagement in SNS doxing. Through this study, we offer rich theoretical and practical insights into the prevention of SNS doxing.},

@article{LichtiTumasjan2023b,
 abstract = {Given the growing pervasiveness of information systems (IS) in everyday life, recent research has acknowledged that IS technologies are often not value free but are instead infused with fundamental personal values. However, little is known about how such values explain why people assimilate these technologies and their affordances. In the intriguing case of Bitcoin, personal values—especially libertarian political values—played an essential role in clarifying the ideological underpinnings of Bitcoin and its early adoption. Consequently, we draw on research on personal values and affordance theory to develop and test a model explicating how these personal values guide individuals toward using IS applications with salient affordances that address their values. Specifically, we hypothesize and test how individuals’ personal values (i.e., libertarian political values) influence their attitudes toward Bitcoin affordances and their Bitcoin use behavior using data from a multiple administration survey of 236 users and nonusers of Bitcoin. Our results indicate that libertarian political values affect individuals’ attitudes toward Bitcoin affordances, which in turn mediate the effects of these values on actual Bitcoin use. Our findings advance the field by demonstrating the importance of integrating values into the conceptualization of IS technology affordances.},

 abstract = {This study takes a review and theory development (RTD) approach to synthesizing the software platform literature, offering theoretical perspective and research guidance. In doing so, we conceptualize platform and complementary capabilities for software platform owners and complementors. The review indicates that three dimensions reflect platform capabilities: intermediarity, generativity, and ambidexterity, while complementary capabilities include creativity, interconnectivity, and appropriability dimensions. We derive an integrative framework of software platforms, which explains (1) how software platform owners and complementors improve performance by enhancing their capabilities, and (2) how software platform owners, complementors, and the ecosystem environment coevolve. We then discuss how future research can build on and enrich the research framework},

 abstract = {Insiders’ negligence or abuse is regarded as a leading cause of information security breaches in organizations. As most of the extant studies have largely examined insider threats at a high level of abstraction, the role of situational moral reasoning for information security policy (ISP) violations in specific situations has received little attention. To advance this line of research, this paper opens up a potentially fruitful path for IS researchers by applying situational action theory (SAT) to contextually examine why employees violate ISPs in particular situations. We consider the violations of password security policy, internet use policy, and confidential data security policy, and examine specific violation intents ranging from altruistic to malicious. The results support most of the assertions derived from SAT. We found situational moral beliefs to be the predominant driver for ISP violations across three situations in an organizational setting. However, the moderation effect of moral beliefs was only significant in situations involving sharing passwords and selling confidential data. Sanction certainty and sanction severity were also found to have different effects across situations. We conclude by presenting implications for IS security practitioners and suggestions for future research.},

@article{LiLuoSarathyEtAl2024,
 abstract = {Many online social network (OSN) users exchange health-related information on OSNs to manage their health, obtain support, and offer assistance to others facing similar medical challenges. Nonetheless, OSN users are concerned about the privacy of their health information. Extant studies on online information privacy have largely resorted to a calculus perspective, focusing on the costs and benefits of information exchange with commercial vendors. Such a perspective, however, fails to capture the nuanced flows of personal health information (PHI) on OSNs, which involves more than two parties. To address this gap and further advance the research on information privacy, this paper embraces the theory of contextual integrity to explore the distinctive contextual idiosyncrasies of PHI flow on OSNs. In particular, we examine how context-specific values and norms affect OSN users’ personal privacy norms and their PHI disclosure intentions. Our theory-driven empirical results suggest that contextual values and normative expectations related to technology control, legislation, and peer users collectively influence OSN users’ personal privacy norms. In addition, perceived personal value and perceived altruistic value serve as motivators to promote PHI disclosure intentions, working in tandem with personal privacy norms. The key findings of the study also have important implications for policymakers and OSN providers in the context of OSN-mediated healthcare through (1) advancing our understanding of the complex dynamics of PHI flow on OSNs and (2) designing effective information privacy measures (i.e., policies, technical features, and programs) to uphold contextual integrity and nurture the development of patient-centered healthcare paradigms.},

 abstract = {Management earnings forecasts are essential sources of information for organizational shareholders. However, many companies remain in a quandary about how to develop an appropriate governance structure within top management to produce high-quality forecasts. This study investigates how firms with chief information officers (CIOs) impact organizational outcomes in terms of both the frequency and the bias of management earnings forecasts. We integrate the following theories to formulate our hypotheses: upper echelons theory, agency theory, and information processing theory (in conjunction with strategic management literature). Using a sample of firm-years (2000 to 2010), we find robust support for the proposition that firms with CIOs are associated with reduced opportunistic bias in earnings forecasts. In addition, we find that, as information uncertainty increases, firms with CIOs generate management forecasts less frequently and exhibit a reduction in optimistic forecasting bias. Collectively, these findings provide a theory-based understanding of how firms with CIOs can influence forecasting outcomes.},

 abstract = {With the development of gesture-based interaction technologies (e.g., touchscreen devices and kinetic controllers), consumers can directly use their hands to interact with web interfaces, which may assist in creating a sense of touch for consumers. Drawing on feelings-as-information theory, this study investigates the impacts of two types of gesture-based interaction (i.e., touchscreen interaction and mid-air interaction) on consumers’ sense of touch. Results from a laboratory experiment showed that touchscreen interaction elicited a higher sense of touch than mid-air interaction when the importance of product haptic information was high. However, touchscreen interaction did not differ from mid-air interaction in terms of eliciting consumers’ sense of touch when the importance of product haptic information was low. Furthermore, consumers’ sense of touch improved their shopping experience satisfaction by reducing uncertainty about products and fostering attachment to products. Theoretically, this study contributes to the existing literature by empirically investigating the effects of gesture-based interaction on consumers’ bodily sensations, elucidating the role of the sense of touch in affecting consumers’ virtual product experience, and highlighting the impact of the interaction method on consumer behavior. This study also provides practical insights into the application of gesture-based interaction technologies.},

@article{LiuWangLuoEtAl2023,
 abstract = {Individuals are increasingly using novel fitness technologies, such as running applications (apps), to support their workouts. The literature has primarily focused on the use of fitness apps at the individual level (i.e., to improve individuals’ exercise levels) and few studies have investigated the role of fitness apps in facilitating group exercise. Consequently, there is a paucity of information on how to enhance the exercise participation of individuals using fitness apps through the use of groups (i.e., how to entice more individuals to engage in exercise). We selected a running app as the context and focused on a particular feature of this app called “Running Spot,” which facilitates members’ offline group engagement, a topic that has thus far received scant attention in the literature. Drawing on the perspective of psychological distance and relational cohesion theory, we propose that the Running Spot feature facilitating offline group engagement improved group participation in running. To advance this line of research, we utilized a panel dataset of 151 running groups from the running app platform over a period of 38 weeks. The aim was to empirically evaluate the effects of offline group engagement facilitation (e.g., Running Spot) using a combination of the difference-indifferences approach and the propensity score matching technique. Our findings suggest that Running Spot indeed promoted groups’ participation in running. Furthermore, the impact of Running Spot was magnified with smaller groups and groups that were moderately closely located to the designated running spots. Our study contributes to the growing body of knowledge on fitness technologies by revealing ways to support group participation and uncovering the complex impact of offline group engagement facilitation (e.g., Running Spot). Our study has important implications for fitness app developers in that it demonstrates that features facilitating offline group engagement should be prioritized to improve group participation in fitness activities.},

 abstract = {While patient-driven online health communities (OHCs) have long been a fixture of the online healthcare landscape, physician-driven OHCs are becoming increasingly popular. Drawing on the persuasive communication literature, this study takes a physician’s perspective to examine how physicians signal their professional expertise and caring demeanor through online responses and influence patient medical service subscription decisions. By analyzing textual and image data collected from a leading physician-driven OHC, we found that regarding message framing, caring messages (emotional appeals) significantly boosted subscriptions among chronically ill patients, while technical messages (rational appeals) did not. The results were found to be the opposite for source framing: authoritative reputation (rational appeals) had a significant effect but smiling images (emotional appeals) did not. The results also punctuate the importance of congruence between message and source and between text and image in both rational and emotional appeals. Our findings make significant theoretical contributions and offer guidance for physicians seeking to optimize their OHC participation to enhance chronic disease care.},

We develop a game-theoretical model in which a manufacturer makes channel choices, a retailer selects product lines, and both need to take the other’s strategy into consideration. We compare the results with cases where no interactions are involved to explicate how the manufacturer’s online channel choice affects the retailer’s store brand strategy, and vice versa. The results suggest that the retailer executes a more defensive strategy if the threat of the online channel is severe but tends to be cooperative when the threat is less alarming. The manufacturer, however, would rather give up its efficient online channel to act cooperatively when the store brand is introduced. Our findings explain certain stylized facts regarding supply chain coordination.},

@article{LuoZhangLu2022,
 abstract = {Today’s app market is highly competitive and rapidly growing. This study considers two app developers with substitutable apps and a continuum of consumers with heterogeneous preferences. Each developer decides between offering a paid app and offering a free basic app with in-app purchases. Because of product fit uncertainty, consumers are not sure about the degree of misfit between the app and their preferences, and that uncertainty can be reduced by trying the free basic app. Using a game-theoretic modeling framework, we analyze how product fit uncertainty affects competing developers’ profits and examine the scenario in which each developer offers a paid app or a free basic app with in-app purchases in a duopoly setting. The analytical results suggest that the developer can offer a free basic app for consumer learning even if the app is not underestimated. When either developer offers a free trial, the developer with the higher-quality app will prefer higher product fit uncertainty, but the one with the lower-quality app will favor lower product fit uncertainty. Additionally, as the app quality increases or consumer preferences become stronger, developers may switch the strategy depending on the reduction in product fit uncertainty caused by the free trial. Our study establishes the usefulness of the freemium strategy beyond the contexts analyzed in the literature. The results explain empirical observations of the app market and provide recommendations about the information disclosure of fit attributes in a competitive market.},

@article{LuPhangBaEtAl2024,
 abstract = {Given the significant influence of online product reviews on consumer purchases, firms are trying to be more proactive in leveraging the influence of reviews. One way of doing this is to offer free product samples to consumers to incentivize product reviews, displaying them along with a disclosure in the existing pool of organic reviews in the hopes of stimulating sales. However, it is not clear whether such product sampling reviews are indeed beneficial to sales, considering that they may have a nontrivial influence on the generation of organic reviews. Based on data from a leading e-commerce platform in China, we found that sponsored product sampling reviews promoted product sales but also reduced the volume of organic reviews for the targeted product. However, the net effect on sales remained positive, suggesting that e-tailers may wish to utilize sponsored product sampling reviews. We also conducted a scenario-based experiment to reveal how the nature of product sampling reviews affects consumers’ brand quality and fairness perceptions. Based on our findings we offer future research directions to improve the understanding of how to better harness the power of sponsored reviews.},

Building on impression formation and gender stereotype research and theory, we develop a two-study research methodology for examining how impressions of technology users are formed. The results of our two studies indicate that technology use is an important component in impression formation, significantly inhibiting the effects of gender stereotyping, such that women and men are not evaluated differently based on their apparent competency in using technology nor on the content of their messaging. Our findings indicate that the use of technology subverts both the male and female stereotypes that observers normally engage.},

@article{MaierLaumerSunEtAl2024,
 abstract = {This study sheds light on how shocks, or events perceived as jarring, cause users to discontinue a service. We use image theory to develop a model of discontinuation (MOD), which includes five main concepts: shock, script, image violation, service and task dissatisfaction, and search for and evaluation of superior alternatives. MOD explains how two types of user discontinuation behavior—quitting and switching—are formed along seven paths that are either related to contextual or technological shocks or result from dissatisfaction with a task or service. Our first empirical study shows that more than 95% of the 467 ex-users surveyed followed one of these paths when discontinuing media streaming, social networking, and matchmaking services. In the second study, we developed a research model based on the MOD to understand how the psychological factors associated with shocks lead to the intention to discontinue. We evaluate this model with a scenario study in which we present the situation of users of a matchmaking service and present participants with a contextual shock. Data from 201 individuals show that users are likely to develop intentions to quit when they use an engaged script or experience an image violation. Interviews with a panel of practitioners confirmed that MOD provides a useful and applicable approach to understanding users’ quitting and switching behaviors in different contexts. We conclude our paper with a discussion of implications for research and practice.},

 abstract = {Post-acceptance IS use is the key to leveraging value from IS investments. However, it also poses many demands on the user. Drawing on the challenge-hindrance stressor framework, this study develops a theory to explain how and why IS use stressors influence post-acceptance use. We identify two different types of IS use stressors: challenge IS use stressors and hindrance IS use stressors. We hypothesize that they are appraised through challenge IS use appraisal and hindrance IS use appraisal, respectively, through which they influence routine use and innovative use. We evaluate our hypotheses by surveying 178 users working in one organization and analyze the data collected using consistent partial least square (PLSc). We find that challenge IS use stressors positively influence routine use and innovative use via challenge IS use appraisal. Hindrance IS use stressors negatively influence routine use via hindrance IS use appraisal. We then dive deeper into these findings using a two-step fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), identifying the presence of challenge IS use stressors and challenge IS use appraisal as necessary conditions for high innovative use. We also reveal that the presence of hindrance IS use stressors and hindrance IS use appraisal only influences routine use and innovative use in the absence of challenge IS use stressors and challenge IS use appraisal. We discuss the practical relevance and transferability of our findings based on a comprehensive applicability check. Our findings advance IS scholarship of IS use stress and post-acceptance use by showing how routine use and innovative use emanate from IS use stressors.},

@article{MaierLaumerThatcherEtAl2021a,
 abstract = {This research explains why individuals resume using social networking sites (SNSs) after terminating their use. Drawing on return migration theory, we developed a theory-driven model of SNS resumption that includes two novel antecedents of SNS resumption behavior: nonuse-related dissatisfaction and use-related satisfaction. We also hypothesize that dispositional resistance to change moderates the impact of nonuse-related dissatisfaction and use-related satisfaction on resumption. We used a mixed methods approach to refine and evaluate the research model. Study 1 used the critical incident method to identify SNS-specific antecedents of nonuse-related satisfaction and use-related satisfaction, allowing us to refine the research model. Study 2 used structural equation modeling to evaluate our research model using two three-wave surveys: one with recent ex-users who recently decided to stop using and delete their profiles on Facebook and one with long-standing ex-users who stopped using and deleted their profiles on Facebook a long time ago. We found support for most relationships in our model: nonuse-related dissatisfaction and use-related satisfaction drive resumption intentions, and dispositional resistance moderates these relationships. Furthermore, we found that the time elapsed since users discontinued Facebook moderated these relationships such that the effect of nonuse-related dissatisfaction on resumption intention is stronger for recent ex-users and the effect of use-related satisfaction is stronger for long-standing ex-users. Our findings advance the understanding of resumption, an understudied behavior of the IT lifecycle and IT use and acceptance research.},

@article{MarkusRowe2023,
 abstract = {The forthcoming JAIS special issue on “Envisioning Digital Transformation” is predicated on the assumption that theoretical diversity would be a good thing for the IS field. But making sense of theoretical diversity requires either a common frame of reference or crystal clarity about concept definitions and the phenomena to which they point. In this editorial, we argue that the IS field still lacks the conceptual and empirical clarity needed to benefit from theoretical diversity about digital transformation. The digital transformation label has been applied to the evolution of technology, as well as to the evolution of organizations and society. It has been used to refer to change in entities or processes and to processes of change. It has been used to refer to particular technological artifacts and to particular kinds of data and processing power. This type of diversity risks obscuring the value of diverse theoretical formulations. Only through clear distinctions and precise labeling of older and new phenomena can the IS field fully benefit from new theories and theoretical elaborations about digital transformation.},

@article{MarxMirbabaieStieglitz2025,
 abstract = {Digital nomads are knowledge workers who leverage information technology (IT) to perpetually travel while working independently of any organizational membership. Corporate nomads are individuals who adopt a nomadic lifestyle but remain permanent employees, which places them in a field of tension between corporate work and digital nomadism—two conceptions of work previously deemed incompatible. To resolve this professional paradox, we conducted qualitative interviews with corporate nomads to better understand how they succeeded (or failed) in holding together two disparate fields with competing values and worldviews. Drawing on ideas from the boundary work literature, we developed a process model of boundary coworking in the context of corporate nomadism. The model incorporates the finding that corporate nomadism unfolds along three phases: (1) splintering, (2) calibrating, and (3) harmonizing. This requires mutual engagement in IT-driven boundary work from both the corporate nomad and their organizational environment. Consequently, corporate nomadism can be understood as an extreme form of “working from anywhere” in which individuals work as spatiotemporal outliers within otherwise settled organizational structures. Practitioners may find value in this study because it discusses managerial implications for recruiting, leading, and retaining corporate nomads.},

@article{MattsonAurigemmaRen2023b,
 abstract = {Regardless of what security professionals do to motivate personal users to adopt security technologies volitionally, the end result seems to be the same—low adoption rates. To increase these rates, we propose activating their positive psychological capital (PsyCap), which consists of hope, self-efficacy, resilience, and optimism (i.e., their “HERO within”). We propose that greater PsyCap toward a security technology is associated with greater adoption rates (and intentions thereof) because positivity increases motivation. We further posit that PsyCap both moderates and is moderated by other constructs. We suggest that personal users’ conditioned fear from the security threat moderates the effect of PsyCap on adoption intentions because some fear is necessary to activate their positive PsyCap to form their behavioral intentions to adopt security technologies. We further hypothesize that PsyCap moderates the effect of adoption intentions on actual adoption rates because activating an individual’s HERO within encourages individuals to exert the effort necessary to translate their intentions into actual adoption. Finally, we theorize that enhancing fear appeal messages with appeals to an individual’s HERO has a greater effect on volitional adoption rates relative to messages without these PsyCap-related appeals. To support our hypotheses, we conducted two experiments using the volitional adoption of a password manager application and a two-factor authentication (2FA) service. We found differential support for our hypotheses across the two security technologies, which suggests technology characteristics might mitigate the impact of PsyCap on volitional adoption decisions.},

@article{MeskeJunglasTrierEtAl2025,
 abstract = {Social networks are omnipresent in both our private and professional lives. As social beings, we thrive on technology’s ability to allow us to be social. But just because online social networks have been designed for “being social” as their name suggests, it does not mean they are actually supportive and representative of the rich social interchanges that take place when individuals communicate in a physical setting. Grounded in relational social capital and relational sociology, we examine the aspect of relational quality—a concept that has been neglected thus far in the bigger picture of social networks. Relational quality describes the richness of the relationship that develops between individuals through social interactions. Since current approaches to social networks mostly focus on structural and cognitive properties, our aim is to derive four theoretically motivated markers for relational quality, comprising markers for being personal, being curious, being respectful, and sharing with others, that—conceptually as well as methodologically—complement existing social network measures. By analyzing more than 440,000 messages posted by more than 24,000 employees across two enterprise social networks (ESN), we illustrate and validate the existence of relational quality in social networks, using sample measures for each marker. We further uncover important relationships between different forms of structural embeddedness and our dimensions of relational quality in online networks.},

@article{MikalsenMonteiro2021a,
 abstract = {Data-driven data science challenges our conceptualization of “data.” Significantly beyond capturing a given phenomenon, data, increasingly, are the phenomenon. Data may be iteratively manipulated algorithmically, undermining the “faithfulness” of data to any originating phenomenon. Crucially, data that are not “faithful” are inherently uncertain, as data risk becoming meaningless symbols. We empirically study how a community of commercially based geoscientists grapples with the phenomenon of offshore oil and gas reservoirs located kilometers below the seabed. The data available about these reservoirs are algorithmically manipulated sensor-based Internet of Things data. Our main contribution is the articulation of three patterns of work practices detailing how inherently uncertain data are woven into consequential work practices: (1) Accumulating is the cumulative process of supporting and triangulating one set of data with supplementary data sets; accumulating captures the conservative approach of backing up existing interpretations of the data. (2) Reframing describes the process where existing interpretations are contested by new data or models; reframing captures that there are limits to how far data can be manipulated. (3) Prospecting, or the cultivation of competing, incompatible data interpretations; while the former two patterns essentially attempt to regulate uncertainty, prospecting is about embracing it. Our concept of data-centric knowing is constituted by these three interwoven, ongoing practices.},

 abstract = {This paper draws attention to the potential of computational methods in reworking data generated in past qualitative studies. While qualitative inquiries often produce rich data through rigorous and resource-intensive processes, much of this data often remains unused. In this paper, we first make a general case for secondary analysis of qualitative data by discussing its benefits, distinctions, and epistemological aspects. We then argue for opportunities with computationally intensive secondary analysis, highlighting the possibility of drawing on data assemblages spanning multiple contexts and time frames to address cross-contextual and longitudinal research phenomena and questions. We propose a scheme to perform computationally intensive secondary analysis and advance ideas on how this approach can help facilitate the development of innovative research designs. Finally, we enumerate some key challenges and ongoing concerns associated with qualitative data sharing and reuse.},

@article{MohlmannndeLimaSalgeMarabelli2022,
 abstract = {Algorithmic management can create work environment tensions that are detrimental to workplace well-being and productivity. One specific type of tension originates from the fact that algorithms often exhibit limited transparency and are perceived as highly opaque, which impedes workers’ understanding of their inner workings. While algorithmic transparency can facilitate sensemaking, the algorithm’s opaqueness may aggravate sensemaking. By conducting an empirical case study in the context of the Uber platform, we explore how platform workers make sense of the algorithms managing them. Drawing on Weick’s enactment theory, we theorize a new form of sensemaking— algorithm sensemaking—and unpack its three sub-elements: (1) focused enactment, (2) selection modes, and (3) retention sources. The sophisticated, multistep process of algorithm sensemaking allows platform workers to keep up with algorithmic instructions systematically. We add to previous literature by theorizing algorithm sensemaking as a mediator linking workers’ perceptions about tensions in their work environment and their behavioral responses.},

@article{MollaKruseKaranasiosEtAl2024,
 abstract = {Experience from contact tracing information systems (IS) relating to COVID-19 shows that designing IS to manage infectious diseases in volatile, urgent, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) situations requires navigation of the interplay between several factors: technical features, the challenges of optimizing timeliness, sensitivity, public value, the urgent need for mass adoption, and unprecedented privacy, trust, and ethical dilemmas. In this paper, using a design archaeology approach, we analyzed the historical, stakeholder, artifactual, aesthetic, instrumental, and symbolic dimensions of COVIDSafe—a contact tracing IS implemented by the Australian Government. Based on the findings, we embarked on design theorizing, moving from the specific instance of the COVID-19 pandemic and COVIDSafe to the broader problem of VUCA health situations and solutions (i.e., infectious disease management information systems [IDMIS]). We contribute a new design theory for IDMIS specifying the aims and scope of the future design efforts for which the design theory can be useful, the roles of different stakeholders, and a set of design principles that clearly define actors, contexts, mechanisms, and rationale. We also discuss the usability of our inductively developed theory. Normatively, we add to the descriptive and explanatory knowledge that promotes a greater understanding of the role of IS in controlling and managing infectious diseases. In terms of method, the study highlights the application of a design archaeology approach for IS design theory research.},

 abstract = {Information security is one of the important domains of information systems research today, with protection motivation theory (PMT) one of its most influential theoretical lenses. However, empirical findings based on PMT are often inconsistent and inconclusive. To reconcile these inconsistent findings, we conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the relationships among PMT constructs while also considering additional contextual constructs that are not specified in PMT. Ninety-two published studies were meta-analyzed and estimated using structural equation modeling. Our results provide support for three of the five predictors of security motivation intention, as postulated by PMT, mixed support for perceived vulnerability, and no support for response cost. We found that coping appraisal variables of response efficacy and self-efficacy have the largest average effects on security behavior. In addition, cultural attributes of collectivism and individualism moderated some of the pairwise correlations, PMT-theoretic relationships were generally stronger in personal contexts than in workplace contexts, and the intention-behavior relationship was strongest in workplace and compliance settings. Our results contribute to the information security literature by providing guidance for future PMT-related research and by demonstrating how meta-analysis and structural equation modeling can be combined to test theories in information systems research.},

 abstract = {In July 2014, Airbnb, one of the biggest firms in the sharing economy, decided to change the way that guests and hosts reviewed each other on the platform. Prior to this change, guests/hosts could post reviews about their experiences asynchronously, the guest/host would be able to see the other partys review whenever it was posted. In contrast, the new review policy rolled out a simultaneous review system, making reviews viewable only after both the guest/host post their own reviews. This study empirically evaluates the impacts of this new review policy on the informativeness of guest reviews, measured by both informational content (semantic diversity and objectivity) and personal opinions (sentiment and sentiment heterogeneity). Using regression discontinuity design and a variety of techniques in the text analytics domain including a novel adaptation of BERT, we demonstrate that Airbnb review policy change enhanced the informational content of guest reviews in terms of semantic diversity and objectivity. We also show that review sentiment was reduced but became more diverse. Subgroup analysis revealed that low-quality listings were subject to more changes than high-quality listings. We further explore the short-term and long-term effects of the review policy change and demonstrate that the simultaneous review system has had a long-lasting impact on the informativeness of guest reviews.},

@article{MuellerBenlian2022,
 abstract = {While much is known about the beneficial effects of agile information systems development (ISD), scholars have largely neglected to address its potential downsides. Specifically, research on this topic has thus far overlooked the ambivalent implications of the specific demands placed on developers working in agile ISD teams, including potentially depleting effects. Drawing on ego depletion theory and the associated literature, we provide a more balanced view and introduce self-regulatory resource depletion triggered by using agile ISD practices—encompassing software development (SD) and project management (PM) practices—as a theoretical perspective on why agile developers experience different levels of work-related fatigue that lead to stronger or weaker turnover intentions. Furthermore, we propose that due to the specific way in which agile ISD methods organize ISD project work, developers’ perceived workload influences the intensity by which agile ISD practices affect self-regulatory resources and developers’ feelings of fatigue. We examined our research model using a multimethod approach including quantitative and qualitative data. We found that the use of agile SD practices enhances developers’ self-regulatory resources and reduces fatigue and turnover intention. Our results also show that perceived workload strengthens the energizing effects of the use of agile SD practices and reveals a depleting effect of the use of agile PM practices, with countervailing implications for turnover intention. This study contributes to agile ISD literature by drawing a more nuanced and balanced picture with both resource-enhancing and resource-draining effects of the use of agile ISD practices. Finally, we give managerial advice regarding factors to consider when designing and managing agile ISD projects.},

@article{MuhammadDeyBalaEtAl2024,
 abstract = {How users with privacy and security concerns engage with social media in light of their perceptions of the risk associated with their digital footprint is a critical question for research and practice. Using a mixed methods approach, we examined the privacy- and security-related concerns of social media users and their subsequent adaptation behaviors in two studies. The first study, a qualitative inquiry, helped us develop a typology of four groups of social media users with respect to their privacy- and security-related attitudes characterized as careless, carefree, conscious, and cautious. We developed a conceptual model comprised of eight hypotheses based on a qualitative study that captured the relationship between privacy- and security-related attitudes and social media adaptation. The second study, a quantitative study, tested the model and revealed that users with careless and carefree attitudes are likely to explore social media to maximize benefits and exploit certain applications, while cautious users are likely to avoid using social media as much as possible. However, the findings are inconclusive for conscious users’ adaptation. This could be due to their systematic and informed decision-making, which is likely to have contextual variability. We contribute by offering a clear and coherent typology and a model of privacy- and security-concerned users’ attitudes and social media adaptation.},

 abstract = {The UN High Commissioner on Refugees (UNHCR) is pursuing a social media strategy to inform people about displaced populations and refugee emergencies. It is actively engaging public figures to increase awareness through its prosocial communications and improve social informedness and support for policy changes in its services. We studied the Twitter communications of UNHCR social media champions and investigated their role as high-profile influencers. In this study, we offer a design science research and data analytics framework and propositions based on the social informedness theory we propose in this paper to assess communication about UNHCR’s mission. Two variables—refugee-emergency and champion type—relate to the informedness of UNHCR champions’ followers. Based on a Twitter sentiment and attitude corpus, we applied a five-step design science analytics framework involving machine learning and natural language processing to test how the emergency type and champion type impact social communication patterns. Positive and neutral sentiment dominated the tweets of the champions and their followers for most refugee-emergency types. High participation-intensity champions emphasized high-intensity emergencies with tweet patterns reflecting dominant positive or neutral sentiment and sharing/liking attitudes. However, we found that sports figures effects were limited in spreading UNHCR’s message, despite their millions of followers. We demonstrate the power of data science for prosocial policy based on refugee crisis awareness and instantiate our methods and knowledge contributions in a research framework that derives knowledge, decisions, and actions from behavioral, design, and economics of information systems perspectives.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we revisit the issue of collaboration with artificial intelligence (AI) to conduct literature reviews and discuss if this should be done and how it could be done. We also call for further reflection on the epistemic values at risk when using certain types of AI tools based on machine learning or generative AI at different stages of the review process, which often require the scope to be redefined and fundamentally follow an iterative process. Although AI tools accelerate search and screening tasks, particularly when there are vast amounts of literature involved, they may compromise quality, especially when it comes to transparency and explainability. Expert systems are less likely to have a negative impact on these tasks. In a broader context, any AI method should preserve researchers’ ability to critically select, analyze, and interpret the literature.},

@article{NieZhengSarkar2021a,
 abstract = {Firms compete intensely in sponsored search. Their bidding strategies hinge on understanding who competes with whom, how they compete, and how consumers react to competing advertisements. In this context, we investigate how firm competition impacts consumers’ click-through behaviors in search advertising from a strategic group perspective. Using search results from Google and consumers’ clickstream data, we found strong negative externality for competitors within the same strategic group relative to competitors across strategic groups: firms reap fewer click-throughs when an advertisement of another firm from the same strategic group is also displayed in search results, relative to when other displayed advertisers are not from the same group. This indicates that when competitors from the same strategic group are likely to appear in the results of a sponsored search auction, the focal firm would be better off avoiding head-to-head competition in the auction. However, we did not find empirical evidence of such firm behaviors, suggesting myopia or the inability of firms to avoid such competition. We also show that when multiple firms from the same strategic group appear in search results, the closer the focal firm is located to such competing firms, the more click-throughs the firm accrues. This suggests that firms should stay close to their within-group competitors when they compete in the same search auction. Further, our empirical results indicate that firms are indeed doing so. Using another set of data from Google AdWords reports, we show that our findings are also robust to multi-keyword bidding scenarios. These findings represent the first attempt to understand the impact of strategic groups in search advertising and provide interesting implications for advertisers and search engines.},

 abstract = {Sponsored search advertising has become an important venue for firms competing for consumers. As a result, many keywords attract a large number of bidders, and the competing advertisers may be quite heterogeneous. We examine whether this heterogeneity impacts how consumers perceive and react to such competitions. To this end, we draw on the theory of strategic groups to prescribe the structure of the competitive environment and investigate how strategic groups impact consumers’ clicking and website-visit behavior when viewing sponsored search results. Our unique datasets that combine search results from Google and consumers’ clickstream data enable us to disentangle such an impact. We find strong positive externality for within-group competitors relative to across-group competitors: (1) consumers are more likely to co-visit two firms that belong to the same strategic group, as opposed to two firms from different groups when both firms appear in the search results; (2) the presence of a firm in the search results primes consumers to visit other firms from the same strategic group even when the other firms do not appear in the search results. Our findings contribute to the sponsored search and strategic group literature by theorizing and empirically verifying consumers’ website-visit behaviors from the strategic group perspective.},

@article{NissenConradSeeberEtAl2025,
 abstract = {Virtual influencers have received significant recent research attention. Past work has investigated users’ perceptions of their human-likeness, uncanniness, trust, and ability to persuade. However, the findings are mixed, motivating new theoretical approaches and investigations into the antecedents of the typically utilized variables. We thus took an exploratory, inductive approach by conducting two neuroimaging experiments with complementary brain imaging techniques and then derived theoretical explanations based on the findings. We discovered three key antecedents that impact human and virtual influencer evaluations: (1) expectancy violation, (2) emotion, and (3) cognitive effort. To validate their explanatory power, we tested their effects on the intention to follow influencer recommendations using uncanniness, trust and distrust as serial mediators in a third behavioral study. Results confirm our interpretation of neural results and reveal three explanatory paths towards following intentions with human and virtual influencers: expectancy violation → uncanniness; emotion → trust/distrust; and cognitive effort → follow intentions. Given the lack of theorizing on expectancy violation, emotion, and cognitive effort in the existing research on virtual influencers, we offer a significant theoretical contribution to the field by showing how these features fundamentally predict further evaluations. Our results can guide design theories for the creation of virtual influencer accounts, help companies to better evaluate the predictors for successful virtual influencer marketing, and inform future information systems studies interested in taking an exploratory, inductive approach using neurophysiological data.},

@article{OllierMalaterreFoucreault2021a,
 abstract = {Individuals are increasingly connected with their coworkers on personal and professional social network sites (SNS) (e.g., Facebook), with consequences for workplace relationships. Drawing on SNS research and on social identity and boundary management theory, we surveyed 202 employees and found that coworkers’ friendship acts (e.g., liking, commenting) were positively associated with closeness to coworkers when coworkers were similar in age to or older than the respondent and were positively associated with organizational citizenship behaviors towards coworkers (OCBI) when coworkers were similar in age. Conversely, harmful behaviors from coworkers (e.g., disparaging comments) were negatively associated with closeness when coworkers were older than the respondent, and with OCBI when coworkers were older than the respondent and coworkers’ friendship acts were high. Preferences for work-life segmentation moderated the relationship between coworkers’ friendship acts and OCBI (but not closeness) such that the positive relationship was stronger when the respondent had low (vs. high) preferences for segmentation. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of this study and propose an agenda for future research.},

Drawing on Foucault’s theorization on subjectivity and power, our case study of community health workers in rural India reveals that the adoption of an mHealth application simultaneously subordinated and strengthened the subjectivity of the community health workers. The study explicates the process through which the health workers oscillated between the enhancement of their individual efficacy, and their submission to institutionalized power as facilitated by the mHealth application during their everyday work practices. Thus, by shifting the focus from “who” is digitally included to “how” they become digitally included, our research provides a fresh perspective that enriches and deepens the discourse of digital inclusion. It generates both theoretical and practical implications for anyone interested in understanding digital inclusion from a more granulated and practice-based perspective.},

@article{PanKwakKuemEtAl2024a,
 abstract = {Because phishing attacks often exploit individuals’ inexperience in detecting them, it is important for managers to provide workers with proper feedback on their reactions to phishing scams. However, little is known about what types of feedback are more effective in facilitating antiphishing training behavior and performance. The objectives of this study are to identify (1) the determinants of decision avoidance and detection accuracy, (2) the contextual effect of type of feedback in antiphishing training, (3) the impacts of perceived detection efficacy on training outcomes, and (4) the interaction effects between feedback characteristics and perceived detection efficacy/phishing characteristics on training outcomes. Drawing upon goal-setting theory, skill acquisition theory, and antiphishing training literature, our model provides a theoretical account of how feedback characteristics (e.g., type, quantity), phishing characteristics (e.g., phishing cue saliency), and perceived detection efficacy affect antiphishing training outcomes (e.g., decision avoidance and detection accuracy). To empirically test the model, we performed four experiments with 652 subjects in the United States from three different online panels via Amazon Mechanical Turk, Esearch.com, and Clickworker.com. Our results indicate that examplebased feedback is superior to abstract feedback in teaching how to correctly discern between phishing and legitimate emails in the context of link-embedded emails. We also show that perceived detection efficacy is essential for a better understanding of antiphishing training behavior and performance. Finally, we show an interaction effect between feedback quantity and phishing cue saliency on antiphishing training behavior and performance.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we focus on the early-stage diffusion of codependent IT innovations, which are a type of innovation in which the overall innovation consists of two complementary parts that are adopted by two different adopter communities but where both parts need to be jointly adopted by the two coadopter communities for successful diffusion of the overall innovation. Using innovation diffusion, organizing vision (OV), and institutional entrepreneurship theories as the key theoretical lenses, and an in-depth case study reconstructed using 20 years of discourse surrounding Walmart’s campaign in the early stage of diffusion of the RFID-in-retailing technology, we develop a fourphase process model for the early-stage diffusion of codependent IT innovations. We make three specific contributions to the IS discipline, specifically to the literature on IS innovation adoption and diffusion. First, we add the notion of coadopter relative advantage and posit that the organization in the coadopter community with a higher coadopter relative advantage that perceives the highest degree of coadopter relative advantage will emerge as an institutional entrepreneur (IE) and will influence the early-stage diffusion of the codependent IT innovation. Second, we add the notion of an internal-external influencer and posit that the IE may be an actor who is internal to the overall adoption phenomenon, which involves two different coadopter communities, but external to the coadopter community with a lower coadopter relative advantage that adopts the innovation component. Third, we divide the early-stage diffusion process into four phases—emergence, structuralization, evolution, and chasm—and identify the institutional entrepreneurship strategies used and the OV functions enacted by the IE during each phase. We propose that the IE for a codependent innovation will: (1) use the rationale development strategy and enact the interpretation OV function during the emergence phase, (2) use the resource mobilization strategy and enact the mobilization OV function during the structuralization phase, (3) use the relationship development strategy and enact the legitimation OV function during the evolution phase, and (4) use all the three institutional entrepreneurship strategies and enact all the three OV functions during the chasm phase.},

 abstract = {This study examines the role that business intelligence (BI) and communication technologies play in how firms may achieve organizational sensing agility, decision making agility, and acting agility in different organizational and environmental contexts. Based on the information-processing view of organizations and dynamic capability theory, we suggest a configurational analytic framework that departs from the standard linear paradigm to examine how IT’s effect on agility is embedded in a configuration of organizational and environmental elements. In line with this approach, we use fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to analyze field survey data from diverse industries. Our findings suggest equifinal pathways to organizational agility and the specific boundary conditions of our middle-range theory that determine what role BI and communication technologies play in organizations’ achieving organizational agility. We discuss implications for theory and practice and discuss future research avenues.},

 abstract = {Much information systems research on data science treats data as preexisting objects and focuses on how these objects are analyzed. Such a view, however, overlooks the work involved in finding and preparing the data in the first place, such that they are available to be analyzed. In this paper, we draw on a longitudinal study of data management in the oil and gas industry to shed light on this backroom data work. We find that this type of work is qualitatively different from the front-stage data analytics in the realm of data science but is also deeply interwoven with it. We show that this work is unstable and bidirectional. That is, the work practices are constantly changing and must simultaneously take into account what data might be possible to access as well as the potential future uses of the data. It is also a collaborative endeavor involving cross-disciplinary expertise that seeks to establish control over data and is shaped by the epistemological orientation of the oil and gas domain.},

@article{PetterGiddens2023,
 abstract = {Individuals who have experienced harm (also known as victims) by people, organizations, or adverse events sometimes use social media to share their experiences with others, search for information, and find social support. While some observers offer support and engage in inclusion toward victims on social media, other observers blame victims for their plight and participate in revictimization and exclusion. Victim blaming, which can lead to social exclusion, disproportionately impacts those in society who are already at risk for exclusion and may perpetuate existing racial, ethnic, gender, and economic inequalities. This research provides a theoretical framework to identify reasons why observers engage in such wide-ranging responses to victims on social media. Specifically, we consider social inclusion and exclusion at the confluence of a social phenomenon (victim blaming), a theory (just world theory), and an information technology artifact (social media) among a specific type of actor (observers). Our theoretical framework of social media inclusion and exclusion is informed by just world theory and considers how social media functionalities can promote social media inclusion or exclusion. We also offer research questions to stimulate future research related to social media inclusion, social media exclusion, and just world theory.},

@article{PientaThatcherWrightEtAl2024a,
 abstract = {When cybersecurity units conduct vulnerability assessments to evaluate the security of organizations, they can have unintended consequences for employees. Although cybersecurity personnel may view tactics such as fake phishing attacks and email scanning as protective measures, employees may view them as threats because being singled out as a security risk can harm their standing in the organization. To understand the implications of vulnerability assessments, we examine how organizations’ use of different tactics to identify user vulnerabilities can lead employees to feel betrayed by the cybersecurity unit, resulting in negative cybersecurity outcomes. Drawing on the theory of betrayal aversion, we develop a model that shows that when employees perceive these tactics as harmful, they can lead to an affective state of cybersecurity betrayal, resulting in a damaged relationship with the cybersecurity unit. In collaboration with an organization’s cybersecurity unit, we evaluated our model using an experimental vignette survey, post hoc interviews, and a crosssectional survey with two samples (i.e., employees in the organization and employees from a panel). We found that when organizations conduct vulnerability assessments to enhance cybersecurity, they often induce an affective state of betrayal and increase employees’ active resistance to cybersecurity (i.e., abandonment, avoidance, and sabotage of cybersecurity policies, technologies, and units). The paper concludes with implications for research and practice that explain the unintended consequences of vulnerability assessment and betrayal.},

 abstract = {Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) based on machine learning (ML) hold great promise for improving medical care. Technically, such CDSSs are already feasible but physicians have been skeptical about their application. In particular, their opacity is a major concern, as it may lead physicians to overlook erroneous outputs from ML-based CDSSs, potentially causing serious consequences for patients. Research on explainable AI (XAI) offers methods with the potential to increase the explainability of black-box ML systems. This could significantly accelerate the application of MLbased CDSSs in medicine. However, XAI research to date has mainly been technically driven and largely neglects the needs of end users. To better engage the users of ML-based CDSSs, we applied a design science approach to develop a design for explainable ML-based CDSSs that incorporates insights from XAI literature while simultaneously addressing physicians’ needs. This design comprises five design principles that designers of ML-based CDSSs can apply to implement user-centered explanations, which are instantiated in a prototype of an explainable ML-based CDSS for lung nodule classification. We rooted the design principles and the derived prototype in a body of justificatory knowledge consisting of XAI literature, the concept of usability, and an online survey study involving 57 physicians. We refined the design principles and their instantiation by conducting walk-throughs with six radiologists. A final experiment with 45 radiologists demonstrated that our design resulted in physicians perceiving the ML-based CDSS as more explainable and usable in terms of the required cognitive effort than a system without explanations.},

@article{QiHanJeongEtAl2023,
 abstract = {Firms in IT industries are under constant competitive pressure from incumbent firms and startups to offer innovative products and services. This study explores the effect of mergers and acquisitions (M&As) on firms’ product differentiation in IT industries. The unique characteristics of IT industries, namely hypercompetition, distributed innovation, modularity of products, and the tacit nature of knowledge, make M&As an attractive mechanism to enable IT firms to stay competitive. Drawing on product differentiation theory, we hypothesize a positive effect of M&As on product differentiation and suggest that this relationship is more potent in firms with higher in-house innovation, an exploitative innovation orientation, and under high levels of industry turbulence. We test our hypotheses using M&A transactions from 1996 to 2016 and a unique 10-K textual analysis-based measure of product differentiation. Using the difference-in-differences identification strategy, the following findings are supported: (1) M&As lead to higher product differentiation, (2) in-house innovation capability and exploitation-oriented innovation strategy positively moderate the positive effect of M&As. These results, which are robust to endogeneities and other robustness tests, contribute to theory and managerial practice by shedding light on the role of M&As as an essential mechanism for product innovation and the complementary role of in-house innovation capability and strategy for firms that intend to take advantage of M&As for creating a competitive edge through differentiating their products and services from competitors. These findings have important managerial value, providing an alternative narrative to the current view on M&As in IT industries as a means of absorbing and dismantling the competition.},

 abstract = {Social inclusion—the ability to participate fully in one’s social world—is gaining importance in policy and academic circles. Information systems research has shown how addressing digital divides and expanding individual capabilities could increase the inclusion of marginalized groups. Yet while these contributions are notable, much of early research often overlooked the deep-seated power relations embedded in social structures—organized patterns of relationships, norms, and institutions that perpetuate inequalities and hierarchies based on gender, race, ethnicity, and caste. However, the field has evolved to bring a more nuanced understanding of how social inclusion can be achieved during the implementation of digital projects. Building on these emerging insights, in this paper, we explore how a social infomediary—an intermediary addressing social issues through information provision to marginalized communities—uses a digitally enabled agriculture extension project to build social inclusion in communities. Drawing on a qualitative case study of a social intermediary in India, our research highlights the role of social context in facilitating and constraining social inclusion efforts. Based on our findings, we develop a 4R social inclusion framework for digital development projects that shows the importance of recognition, reposition, representation, and reciprocation in fostering social inclusion. We also identify corresponding processes: transformative narratives and dialogues, empathic scaffolding, structured discursive spaces, and innovative interdependence. We discuss the practical and theoretical implications of our research and provide future research directions.},

 abstract = {Because software is fungible, has low marginal replication costs, and requires relatively high levels of initial investment to develop, understanding how IT-producing firms protect and leverage value from their research and development (R&D) investments is important. We examine how the positioning of IT-producing firms within their networks of strategic alliances moderates profits from R&D investments. We posit that alliances with IT-consuming firms generate relation-specific rents that, in turn, protect the value of R&D investments by making software innovations difficult for rivals to appropriate. Among IT-producing firms, we make a distinction between software consulting and services firms and software package-product firms. Our analyses of 464 IT-producing firms for the 14-year period 1996-2009 suggest that IT-producing firms’ returns on R&D investments increase with alliance ties to IT-consuming firms. We also find that alliances with IT-consuming firms have a more beneficial effect on R&D investment returns for software consulting and services firms than for software package-product firms.

@article{RamakrishnanGregorShresthaEtAl2023,
 abstract = {Knowledge commons play a pivotal role in knowledge creation and sharing in the digital economy. The motivation for this research was the opportunity to develop a knowledge commons for IT service management (ITSM) practitioners. To obtain guidance to design the knowledge commons, we critically reviewed commons design principles (DPs) that were based on a well-established economics theory. We observed that the commons DPs had significant gaps when applied to IS practice. Hence, we developed an alternate set of DPs that we refer to as platform-enabled knowledge commons (PEKC) DPs that are relevant to IS practice. This paper discusses the development of PEKC DPs and applies them in instantiating an IS artifact, Service-Symphony. Service-Symphony is a purpose-built, public-facing knowledge repository developed for the benefit of ITSM practitioners and students. Our research followed the design science research (DSR) paradigm and contributes to the body of knowledge by establishing a multigrounded design theory comprising meta-requirements and DPs. To bridge theory and practice, we assessed the reusability of PEKC DPs through focus group interviews with IS architects. Our case study illustrates the complete life cycle of DPs covering conceptualization, initial formulation, iterative refinement, application to an important real-world instantiation, and evaluation by a group of independent IS practitioners.},

 abstract = {The capacity of digital technology to afford both profound benefits and substantial harm means that careful stewardship of the development, deployment, adoption, and appropriation of digital technologies is required through the practice of digital responsibility. Digital responsibility entails three key aspects: accountability for both harmful and beneficial outcomes of engaging with digital technology, the obligation to enable positive outcomes of digitalization while safeguarding against possible negative consequences of the same, and dependability: a continuous commitment to maintaining accountability and obligation in the face of constantly emerging new digital artifacts and the consequences that flow from their deployment. In this editorial, we develop an organizing framework for investigating digital responsibility, identify different ways in which digital responsibility could manifest in IS research and practice, and summarize how the papers included in this special issue advance our understanding of digital responsibility.},

@article{Rhue2025,
 abstract = {Organizations interested in supporting matters of diversity and equity need guidance on whether to be transparent about their equity-focused initiatives and appeal to users’ sense of social justice. This paper explores how information transparency affects backer responses to equity-related initiatives. The educational crowdfunding platform DonorsChoose launched an “equity-focused” initiative to highlight the platform’s commitment to equity in education and encourage donations towards that cause. Using an observational analysis and an experimental study, I found evidence that information transparency, i.e., explicitly promoting equity-focused projects, dampens overall donations because any change in donations associated with the equity-focused initiatives is insufficient to offset the decrease in other donations. However, I found evidence that distant donors are more responsive to equity-focused recommendations, consistent with the hypothesis that a holistic mindset moderates the effectiveness of promoting equity-focused initiatives. This study provides insight into the trade-offs associated with information transparency for equity-related initiatives and the complicated relationship between organizations and equity-related initiatives.},

@article{RintaKahilaPenttinenSalovaaraEtAl2023,
 abstract = {Cognitive automation powered by advanced intelligent technologies is increasingly enabling organizations to automate more of their knowledge work tasks. Although this often offers higher efficiency and lower costs, cognitive automation exacerbates the erosion of human skill and expertise in automated tasks. Accepting the erosion of obsolete skills is necessary to reap the benefits of technology—however, the erosion of essential human expertise is problematic if workers remain accountable for tasks for which they lack sufficient understanding, rendering them incapable of responding if the automation fails. Though the phenomenon is widely acknowledged, the dynamics behind such undesired skill erosion are poorly understood. Thus, taking the perspective of sociotechnical systems, we conducted a case study of an accounting firm that had experienced skill erosion over a number of years due to reliance on their software’s automated functions. We synthesized our findings using causal loop modeling based on system dynamics. The resulting dynamic model explains skill erosion via an interplay between humans’ automation reliance, complacency, and mindful conduction. It shows how increasing reliance on automation fosters complacency at both individual and organizational levels, weakening workers’ mindfulness across three work task facets (activity awareness, competence maintenance, and output assessment), resulting in skill erosion. Such skill erosion may remain obscure, acknowledged by neither workers nor managers. We conclude by discussing the implications for theory and practice and identifying directions for future research.},

@article{RiveraAbhariXiao2025,
 abstract = {Rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have heightened the need for ethical AI design principles, positioning responsible AI at the forefront across academia, industry, and policy spheres. Despite the plethora of guidelines, responsible AI faces challenges due to fragmentation and the lack of a cohesive explanatory theory guiding research and practice. Existing AI literature frequently fixates on responsible AI attributes within usage contexts, operating under the misapprehension that responsibility can be achieved solely through specific system attributes, responsible algorithms, or minimization of harm. This narrow focus neglects the mechanisms that interlace design decisions with the realization of responsible AI, thereby undervaluing their profound significance. Similarly, information systems literature predominantly emphasizes the operation and usage of these systems, often bypassing the opportunity to weave ethical principles into AI design from its inception. In response, this study adopted a grounded theory approach to theorize responsible AI design from the perspective of AI designers. The authenticity, control, transparency (ACT) theory of responsible AI design emerged as a result. This theory posits that authenticity, control, and transparency are pivotal mechanisms in responsible AI design. These mechanisms ensure that ethical design decisions across three domains—architecture, algorithms, and affordances—translate into responsible AI. The ACT theory offers a parsimonious yet practical foundation for guiding research and practice, aligning ethical AI design with technological advancements and fostering accountability, including algorithmic accountability.},

 abstract = {Scholars and practitioners have long tried to understand the antecedents and consequences of information technology (IT) assimilation. Studies suggest that top management support is an important driver of IT assimilation; however, this broad takeaway provides little substantive guidance to researchers and practitioners. We also have a limited understanding of whether and when IT assimilation creates business value. We take stock of this literature with a meta-analysis. We found that top management support is positively related to IT assimilation, and assimilation is in turn positively related to the business value of IT. We also found that explicit support does not have any special effect on IT assimilation (compared to implicit support) and may not be related to business value at all. However, our results indicate that IT assimilation has a stronger effect on business value at the process level (versus firm level) and for enterprise IT innovations (versus function IT innovations). Finally, we found that support-assimilation and assimilation-value relationships are stronger in high (versus low) power distance cultures. Our collective findings can facilitate future research and help practitioners navigate IT assimilation initiatives.},

 abstract = {False claims and misinformation on social media have substantially increased in the last few years. Some people have incorrectly interpreted such content as the truth, sometimes to the extent that it transforms their view of reality and subsequently leads to actions that cause harm and suffering. Despite the burgeoning body of research on misinformation on social media, we know little about the process by which social media-driven misinformation shapes and reinforces false beliefs that result in detrimental outcomes. Building on insights from dramaturgical tragedy, theories of truth, and research on social media, we develop a process theory that explains how social media-driven misinformation transforms a person’s view of reality in a way that leads to detrimental human action.},

@article{RuoffGnewuchMaedcheEtAl2023,
 abstract = {Governments and health organizations are increasingly using dashboards to provide real-time information during natural disasters and pandemics. Although these dashboards aim to make crisisrelated information accessible to the general public, the average user can have a hard time interacting with them and finding the information needed to make everyday decisions. To address this challenge, we draw on the theory of effective use to propose a theory-driven design for conversational dashboards intended for crisis response that can improve users’ transparent interaction with these dashboards and facilitate access to crisis-related information during crises. We instantiate our proposed design in a conversational dashboard for the COVID-19 pandemic that enables natural language interaction in spoken or written form and helps users familiarize themselves with the use of natural language through conversational onboarding. The evaluation of our artifact shows that being able to use natural language improves users’ interaction with the dashboard and ultimately increases their efficiency and effectiveness in finding information. This positive effect is amplified when users complete the onboarding before interacting with the dashboard, particularly when they can use both natural language and mouse interaction. Our findings contribute to research on dashboard design, both in general and in the specific context of crisis response, by providing prescriptive knowledge for extending crisis response dashboards with natural language interaction capabilities. In addition, our work contributes to the democratization of data science by proposing design guidelines for making information on crisis response dashboards more accessible to the general public.},

@article{SabherwalGroverChatbot2024,
 abstract = {The discourse surrounding the societal impacts of generative artificial intelligence (GAI), exemplified by technologies like ChatGPT, often oscillates between extremes: utopian visions of unprecedented productivity and dystopian fears of humanity’s demise. This polarized perspective neglects the nuanced, pragmatic manifestation of GAI. In general, extreme views oversimplify the technology itself or its potential to address societal issues. The authors suggest a more balanced analysis, acknowledging that GAI’s impacts will unfold dynamically over time as diverse implementations interact with human stakeholders and contextual factors. While Big Tech firms dominate GAI’s supply, its demand is expected to evolve through experimentation and use cases. The authors argue that GAI’s societal impact depends on identifiable contingencies, emphasizing three broad factors: the balance between automation and augmentation, the congruence of physical and digital realities, and the retention of human bounded rationality. These contingencies represent trade-offs arising from GAI instantiations, shaped by technological advancements, stakeholder dynamics, and contextual factors, including societal responses and regulations. Predicting long-term societal effects remains challenging due to unforeseeable discontinuities in the technology’s trajectory. The authors anticipate a continuous interplay between GAI initiatives, technological advances, learning experiences, and societal responses, with outcomes depending on the above contingencies.},

@article{SachinSchecterPandaEtAl2024,
 abstract = {As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more pervasive, humans will interact with autonomous agents more frequently and in deeper ways. While there is a significant body of work addressing the interface between a single human and a single AI agent, less is known about how individuals react to AI when they are part of human-agent hybrids, namely multiple humans and potentially multiple AI. These hybrid forms are unique in that advice is often given simultaneously, i.e., a human decision maker evaluates advice from other humans and algorithms at the same time. This scenario presents a boundary condition on the extant literature, as it is unclear how a human decision maker will differentially appraise a human advisor compared to an algorithmic advisor when their advice is simultaneous. This study presents the results of three experiments asking individuals to estimate property rental prices with the support of both human and algorithmic advice. We tested whether explicitly labeling an advisor as an algorithm rather than a human impacts how individuals perceive both the algorithm and another human advisor. We also examined the role of conflicting advice during simultaneous evaluation. Based on the results of 904 participants, we found that labeling an advisor as an algorithm resulted in a significantly significant algorithmic appreciation bias, even when an equivalent human was present. Further, we found that uncertainty induced by conflicting information weakened the appreciation effect, while agreement among advisors resulted in the strongest behavioral responses.},

@article{SaffarizadehKeilBoodrajEtAl2024,
 abstract = {The use of conversational AI agents (CAs), such as Alexa and Siri, has steadily increased over the past several years. However, the functionality of these agents relies on the personal data obtained from their users. While evidence suggests that user disclosure can be increased through reciprocal self-disclosure (i.e., a process in which a CA discloses information about itself with the expectation that the user would reciprocate by disclosing similar information about themself), it is not clear whether and through which mechanism the process of reciprocal self-disclosure influences users’ post-interaction trust. We theorize that anthropomorphism (i.e., the extent to which a user attributes humanlike attributes to a nonhuman entity) serves as an inductive inference mechanism for understanding reciprocal self-disclosure, enabling users to build conceptually distinct cognitive and affective foundations upon which to form their post-interaction trust. We found strong support for our theory through two randomized experiments that used custom-developed text-based and voicebased CAs. Specifically, we found that reciprocal self-disclosure increases anthropomorphism and anthropomorphism increases cognition-based trustworthiness and affect-based trustworthiness. Our results show that reciprocal self-disclosure has an indirect effect on cognition-based trustworthiness and affect-based trustworthiness and is fully mediated by anthropomorphism. These findings conceptually bridge prior research on motivations of anthropomorphism and research on cognitive and affective bases of trust.},

 abstract = {With societal challenges, including but not limited to human development, equity, social justice, and climate change, societal-level digital transformation (SDT) is of imminent relevance and theoretical interest. While building on local-level efforts, societal-level transformation is a nonlinear extension of the local level. Unfortunately, academic discourse on digital transformation has largely left SDT unaccounted for. Drawing on more than 25 years of intensive, interventionist research engagement with the digital transformation of public healthcare information management and delivery in more than 80 countries in the Global South, we contribute to theorizing SDT in the form of a design theory consisting of six interconnected design principles. These design principles articulate the interplay and tensions of accommodating over time increased diversity and flexibility in digital solutions, while simultaneously connecting local, national, and regional/ global efforts.},

 abstract = {It goes without saying that digital technologies have been forming an increasingly crucial component of companies’ value offerings in recent times. In many industries, this trend has led to converging markets, where traditional firms compete and collaborate with software firms and digital startups. One central competitive factor in these markets is the ability to capitalize on digital options faster than the competition. Prior research on agility in this context has advanced our knowledge on managerial and employee behaviors, as well as structures supporting such behaviors, to enable agility both in traditional and software firms. The challenge for firms in digitally converging markets is that agility now requires a combination of organizational and IS development agility—perceiving these concepts as separate entities is no longer appropriate or instructive. Building on prior work on agile behaviors and structures, and published cases on digital firms, we develop an integrative conception of digital agility in line with the realities of the digital era.},

@article{SarkerSusarlaGopalEtAl2024,
 abstract = {In the rapidly evolving landscape of academic research, artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to revolutionize traditional academic peer review processes and knowledge evaluation systems. We believe that the growing collaboration between humans and AI will disrupt how academics assess scholarly manuscripts and disseminate published works in a way that facilitates the closing of gaps among diverse scholars as well as competing scholarly traditions. Such human-AI collaboration is not a distant reality but is unfolding before us, in part, through the development, application, and actual use of AI, including language learning models (LLMs). This opinion piece focuses on the academic peer review process. It offers preliminary ideas on how human-AI collaboration will likely change the peer review process, highlights the benefits, identifies possible bottlenecks, and underscores the potential for democratizing academic culture worldwide.},

@article{SchankeRayAdomaviciusEtAl2024a,
 abstract = {Social media platforms are increasingly crucial in corporate engagement, but there is limited research delineating how page characteristics influence firm behavior on these platforms. This paper examines the relationship between firm-generated content and user engagement on product pages and whether a page’s characteristics and content motivations moderate this relationship. Analyzing a sample of 29,267 posts on 85 Facebook product pages of 49 Fortune 1000 firms, we studied the relationship between the content (i.e., informational vs. emotional) and style (i.e., formal vs. informal) of a given post and the level of user engagement. The key finding is that in the content dimension, “incongruous” posts, i.e., content not traditionally expected for a product page of a given type, generate more favorable engagement. Also, informal style posts achieve more favorable engagement irrespective of the product page characteristics. The secondary discovery is attributable to Facebook’s function as a social media network where acquaintances engage with one another. The platform’s unwritten protocol of communication largely emphasizes informality, which is likely the driver of this observation. These findings contribute to the burgeoning social media strategy literature illustrating how product page characteristics moderate effective social media content strategies.},

 abstract = {The pervasiveness and increasing sophistication of artificial intelligence (AI)-based artifacts within private, organizational, and social realms are changing how humans interact with machines. Theorizing about the way that humans perceive AI-based artifacts is, for example, crucial to understanding why and to what extent humans deem these artifacts to be competent for decision-making but has traditionally taken a modality-agnostic view. In this paper, we theorize about a particular case of interaction, namely that of voice-based interaction with AI-based artifacts. We argue that the capabilities and perceived naturalness of such artifacts, fueled by continuous advances in natural language processing, induce users to deem an artifact as able to act autonomously in a goal-oriented manner. We show that there is a positive direct relationship between the voice capabilities of an artifact and users’ agency attribution, ultimately obscuring the artifact’s true nature and competencies. This relationship is further moderated by the artifact’s actual agency, uncertainty, and user characteristics.},

@article{SchreieckWiescheKrcmar2022,
 abstract = {Incumbent companies across industries such as banking, insurance, and enterprise software have begun transforming their existing product platform ecosystems into innovation platforms ecosystems to increase generativity in their ecosystems. Such ecosystem transformations not only entail technological challenges as the underlying platform technology changes but also organizational challenges in that ecosystem actors such as partners and customers need to become part of the transformed ecosystem. To study how incumbent companies can govern ecosystem transformations successfully, we interpret ecosystems as organizational fields and ecosystem transformations as changes to the fields’ institutional infrastructure. Based on a multiyear, grounded theory study of the transformation of SAP’s on-premises ERP system, we first identify institutionalization challenges that arise when institutional infrastructure is changed during an ecosystem transformation. We then show how field-level governance mechanisms address these challenges and how the new institutional infrastructure gains legitimacy among ecosystem actors, ultimately leading to the institutionalization of the transformed ecosystem. These findings contribute to the literature on ecosystem transformations and platform governance by highlighting the role that institutional forces play in ecosystem transformations. Furthermore, we add to the literature on institutional theory by providing insights into the dynamics of institutional infrastructure as it becomes infused with digital technologies.},

@article{SchuetzGewaldJohnstonEtAl2025,
 abstract = {IT security remains high on the agenda of CIOs, with employees’ adoption of security behaviors—behaviors that employees adopt to protect organizational IT assets—being a top concern. To explain when employees adopt security behaviors, the information systems security (ISec) literature has mainly employed deductive studies that draw on theory-based assumptions about goals—mostly from behavioral theories used in criminology and public health (e.g., avoiding sanctions, avoiding harm from threats, avoiding disapproval and blame). However, as these theories typically do not theorize about employees’ goals specific to the workplace, they offer limited insights into the goals that employees pursue at work. Subsequently, not much is known about the goals that motivate employees’ security behaviors at work. Against this backdrop, this research provides a complementary, inductive-first inquiry into the work-related goals that drive employees’ security behaviors. Using a qualitative-quantitative mixed methods research design, we identify four goals (Study 1) and evaluate their importance for predicting employee security behaviors (Study 2). Overall, we find evidence that employees’ work performance and blame avoidance goals are the most salient predictors of security behaviors; as a result, our findings suggest that employees engage in security behaviors primarily because they believe it will help them meet supervisors’ expectations—a key goal that has been largely ignored in the previous ISec literature.},

@article{SchultzeBhappu2022,
 abstract = {Organization-sponsored sharing platforms represent the sharing economy ideal because they facilitate the peer-to-peer exchange of goods and services among members of an established community. By embedding sharing within an organization, this platform configuration infuses collaborative consumption with the moral dimension of shared values and concerns. However, the conflicting institutional logics inherent in community-based sharing create paradoxical tensions that are likely to destabilize this new organizational form. Therefore, to understand when an organization-sponsored sharing platform is viable, we conducted an empirical investigation of the Zimride by Enterprise® ridesharing platform for universities and corporations. Using qualitative and quantitative data from 25 organizations that sponsored Zimride’s ridesharing service, we found that this new organizational form is characterized by contradictions due to the market, hierarchy, and community logics of its multilevel B2B2P2P service delivery model. However, the mere presence of such paradoxical tensions did not render this sharing economy ideal infeasible. We therefore discuss when the Zimride platform was viable and how site coordinators at sponsoring organizations managed, in particular, the tension between their organizational members’ need for a heterogeneous supply of transportation options and a strong collective identity to motivate their collaborative consumption.},

@article{SchutzLowryPientaEtAl2021a,
 abstract = {A substantial amount of previous research has examined the efficacy of fear appeals to elicit security-enhancing behaviors from users. However, despite more than a decade of research on fear appeals in security contexts, researchers have yet to understand which factors drive users’ responses to fear appeals. Instead, the literature is riddled with inconsistent findings on the antecedents that predict fear-appeal outcomes, fueling controversy and inhibiting progress on the problem. This research addresses the inconsistent findings by using construal level theory (CLT) to explain how temporal distance and argument nature affect fear-appeal appraisal. Based on two online experiments, we report evidence showing that temporal distance determines which antecedents drive fear-appeal outcomes, which helps explain inconsistent results found in prior literature. Moreover, we found that depending on the temporal distance condition, argument nature (i.e., “how” or “why” arguments) can impact the effectiveness of fear appeals. Overall, our findings refine the understanding of when certain factors influence users’ responses to fear appeals and provide guidance for future research on how to create more effective fear appeals.},

@article{SeegerPfeifferHeinzl2021a,
 abstract = {Conversational agents (CAs) are natural language user interfaces that emulate human-to-human communication. Because of this emulation, research on CAs is inseparably linked to questions about anthropomorphism—the attribution of human qualities, including consciousness, intentions, and emotions, to nonhuman agents. Past research has demonstrated that anthropomorphism affects human perception and behavior in human-computer interactions by, for example, increasing trust and connectedness or stimulating social response behaviors. Based on the psychological theory of anthropomorphism and related research on computer interface design, we develop a theoretical framework for designing anthropomorphic CAs. We identify three groups of factors that stimulate anthropomorphism: technology design-related factors, task-related factors, and individual factors. Our findings from an online experiment support the derived framework but also reveal novel yet counterintuitive insights. In particular, we demonstrate that not all combinations of anthropomorphic technology design cues increase perceived anthropomorphism. For example, we find that using only nonverbal cues harms anthropomorphism; however, this effect becomes positive when nonverbal cues are complemented with verbal or human identity cues. We also find that CAs’ disposition to complete computerlike versus humanlike tasks and individuals’ disposition to anthropomorphize greatly affect perceived anthropomorphism. This work advances our understanding of anthropomorphism and contextualizes the theory of anthropomorphism within the IS discipline. We advise on the directions that research and practice should take to find the sweet spot for anthropomorphic CA design.},

 abstract = {Many moments of political expression on social media networks fail to become online movements. However, studies on these failures and their causes are conspicuously absent in the literature. We had the opportunity to trace such a failure when a contentious policy advocating for the decriminalization of sex work failed to materialize into a cohesive online movement. However, uncovering the reasons behind this failure proved challenging: Why didn’t mobilization happen despite favorable political opportunity structures? Eventually, we turned to existing research on what motivates movement participation and the role of grievances. Shared understandings of grievances are essential for social movements to emerge and be sustained over time. However, the focus on grievance formation has taken the back seat in research on contemporary movements and collective action. Through our interpretation of the sex worker policy protest and by examining existing research on online movements, we advance propositions of the challenges involved in online grievance formation. The propositions contribute to the pursuit of a theory to explain failure in online movements.},

They are the IT applications architecture spread, which is the adoption of a broad array of IT solutions, and IT applications architecture longevity, which is the length of experience with use of specific IT solutions. We examine the extent to which these dimensions of assimilation within the business and clinical work processes impact hospital performance. Compared with the effects of IT applications architecture spread, we find that the IT applications architecture longevity has a more significant effect on financial performance. In addition, the effects of assimilation manifest differently across the business and clinical process domains. Our results enhance understanding about the manner in which the assimilation and use of IT contributes to the financial performance of hospitals.},

 abstract = {Developers have long strived to create virtual avatars that are more realistic because they are believed to be preferred over less realistic avatars. However, an “uncanny valley” exists in which avatars trigger aversion when they are almost but not quite realistic. We used a field study to investigate whether users had different affinity, trustworthiness, and preferences for avatars with two levels of realism, one that was close to human-realistic and one a cartoon caricature. We observed behavior, conducted one-on-one interviews, and collected survey data from SIGGRAPH conference attendees who either participated in a live discussion session between two avatars in a VR environment, or observed it via 3D VR headsets or on a large screen 2D video display. Eighteen sessions were conducted over four days, with the same person animating the human-realistic avatar and different guests animating the caricature avatars. The guests who interacted with the human-realistic avatar had a positive experience in the VR environment. The observers had positive evaluations of both avatars while acknowledging their different levels of realism. They rated the human-realistic avatar as more trustworthy, had more affinity for it, and preferred it as a virtual agent. Participants who observed the interview through VR headsets had an even stronger affinity for the human-realistic avatar and stronger preferences for it than those who observed via the 2D screen. Effect sizes ranged from medium to large. Our results suggest that it is now possible to cross the uncanny valley with human-realistic avatars rendered in real time.},

@article{ShankarWangGunastiEtAl2024,
 abstract = {Peer feedback is often associated with an increase in the contributions of members in online communities. Verbal feedback (such as a review) can give details about how the recipient can improve their contribution, but it requires the recipient to read and process the feedback. Conversely, nonverbal feedback (such as an upvote) is easy to comprehend but does not convey much helpful information. Prior studies have mainly focused on the impact of verbal feedback. However, little has been done to explore the underlying mechanism of the effect of nonverbal peer feedback on people’s tendency to contribute more. We present two experimental studies conducted on Amazon Mechanic Turk. Study 1 demonstrates how verbal and nonverbal feedback impact user contributions differently. Next, building on attribution-emotion-action theory, we use Study 2 to establish a causal mechanism between nonverbal feedback and users’ knowledge contribution. Specifically, users who receive nonverbal peer feedback make internal and external attributions, which in turn impact their emotions and contribution decisions. We find that users receiving more positive feedback attribute this in equal measure internally to perceived self-efficacy and externally to perceived fairness, whereas users who receive negative feedback attribute it more to the lack of perceived fairness of peer feedback. These findings have important implications for both content-sharing platforms and researchers trying to better understand the drivers of online content-sharing behavior.},

 abstract = {The success of open source software (OSS) projects depends on sustained contributions by developers who often display a wide variety of contribution patterns. Project leaders and stakeholders would strongly prefer that developers not only maintain but preferably increase their contributions over time as they gain experience. Corporations increasingly complement OSS developer motivations (such as fit in terms of shared values with the project community) by paying them to sustain contributions. However, practitioners argue whether payment helps or hurts projects because monetary compensation may dampen developer motivation in the long run, making it difficult for project leaders to understand what to expect from developers over time. Using Herzberg motivation-hygiene framework, we explore how developer perceptions of value fit with the project and being paid interact to determine the level of code contribution and its rate of change over time (i.e., growth). Using a survey of 564 developers across 431 projects on GitHub, we build a three-level growth model explaining the code contribution and its growth over a six-month period. We find that value fit with the project positively influences both the level and growth of code contribution. However, there are notable differences among paid and unpaid developers in the impact of value fit on their level and growth in code contributions over time. The implications of our work will be of interest to researchers, practitioners, and organizations investing in open source projects.},

@article{ShirishSrivastavaBoughzala2023b,
 abstract = {Rapid developments in real-time collaborative technologies, coupled with the quest for innovation and creativity, have made global virtual teams (GVTs) a viable workplace collaboration option that many companies are turning to. Although diverse team member perspectives in GVTs are expected to foster creativity, cultural diversity within GVTs also poses significant challenges related to knowledge exchange and integration among team members. Grounding our work in the team adaptation and cultural intelligence (CQ) literatures, we suggest CQ as a plausible modality for cultural adaptation in GVTs. Specifically, we propose a nomological network comprising CQ dimensions (motivation, cognition, metacognition, and behavior) serving as a cultural adaptation mechanism for fostering creativity in GVT outcomes. We contextualize and extend CQ theory, which has previously focused on face-to-face contexts, to the virtual collaborative GVT environment. For this, we conceptualize the significant role of deep-level implicitly negotiated adaptative behavior (role structure adaptation) in GVTs—in addition to surface-level explicitly displayed adaptative behavior (CQ behavior). We tested the proposed model through a sequential mixed methods approach that integrated the results from a quantitative two-wave survey study with findings from a qualitative study comprising expert interviews, to arrive at rich and robust inferences and metainferences. The proposed CQ-for-GVT framework, along with delineated boundary conditions and associated propositions, explicates an integrative model explaining the role of CQ for GVT creativity performance. The delineated model not only has theoretical implications but also provides useful directions for GVT practitioners.},

@article{ShmueliRay2024a,
 abstract = {The editorial process at our leading information systems journals has been pivotal in shaping and growing our field. But this process has grown long in the tooth and is increasingly frustrating and challenging its various stakeholders: editors, reviewers, and authors. The sudden and explosive spread of AI tools, including advances in language models, make them a tempting fit in our efforts to ease and advance the editorial process. But we must carefully consider how the goals and methods of AI tools fit with the core purpose of the editorial process. We present a thought experiment exploring the implications of two distinct futures for the information systems powering today’s journal editorial process: an AI-augmented and an AI-driven one. The AI-augmented scenario envisions systems providing algorithmic predictions and recommendations to enhance human decision-making, offering enhanced efficiency while maintaining human judgment and accountability. However, it also requires debate over algorithm transparency, appropriate machine learning methods, and data privacy and security. The AI-driven scenario, meanwhile, imagines a fully autonomous and iterative AI. While potentially even more efficient, this future risks failing to align with academic values and norms, perpetuating data biases, and neglecting the important social bonds and community practices embedded in and strengthened by the human-led editorial process. We consider and contrast the two scenarios in terms of their usefulness and dangers to authors, reviewers, editors, and publishers. We conclude by cautioning against the lure of an AI-driven, metric-focused approach, advocating instead for a future where AI serves as a tool to augment human capacity and strengthen the quality of academic discourse. But more broadly, this thought experiment allows us to distill what the editorial process is about: the building of a premier research community instead of chasing metrics and efficiency. It is up to us to guard these values.},

 abstract = {Mobile device applications are the largest segment of IS with an estimated 5 billion users. Yet despite their widespread and growing use, there is little research examining how these mobile applications evolve with each new release update. To ensure market success, developers need to satisfy their user base by incorporating users’ reviews and feedback on the one hand and exploring new features and content that allow them to stay competitive on the other. Drawing on the organizational learning and innovation literature, the findings of the present study suggest that a mix of these two activities of exploitation and exploration in consequent app updates is likely to result in the app’s success. We further contribute to this body of work by examining the influence of users’ online review characteristics on exploitation and exploration activities in app development. The findings suggest that users’ convergence on similar issues (review concurrence) is likely to favor an orientation prioritizing exploitation over exploration activities, while the number of user reviews (review volume) has a curvilinear relationship with it.},

@article{SimeonovaKellyKaranasiosEtAl2024,
 abstract = {The information systems (IS) field has not consistently dealt with the importance of power in theory, research, or practice, because of epistemological and theoretical challenges for studying power in IS. In responding to these issues, we develop an accessible “power-sensitive” framework, using the episodic/systemic view of power and an activity theory (AT) view of organizational practices. We draw on two cases of IS work. Case 1 focuses on information technology (IT) organizations in Bulgaria, and Case 2 focuses on a global development sector nongovernmental organization (NGO) in Thailand. While much of the IS literature emphasizes cutting-edge innovations, this paper highlights mundane yet widespread IS applications such as email and spreadsheets. We elaborate on lessons learned from the cases and develop a power-sensitive framework to support IS researchers and practitioners seeking to acknowledge power in different IS contexts. The paper has two main aims and contributions: to illustrate how power can be articulated using the episodic/systemic view and AT by providing a more dynamic perspective that goes beyond traditional views of power as possessive, hierarchical, and static, and to deploy the cases strategically as part of a broader call for more consideration of power in IS research, illustrating the important insights such a focus can provide. We argue against simply ignoring power or considering it as a “nuisance” in IS research. Instead, we argue that power is endemic to IS work and an integral aspect of everyday IS practices. We characterize this view of power as “present-in-actions” in IS.},

@article{SimLeeCho2023,
 abstract = {In response to the burgeoning threats of climate change to humanity, numerous governments, such as those of the United States and most European countries, have launched rollout programs for the distribution of smart metering technology (SMT). Despite this notable recent investment, questions of whether and why SMT adoption facilitates the reduction of households’ energy demands remain relatively unexplored. Building on cognitive dissonance theory, we propose a research model for SMT adoption, residential energy-saving behaviors, and moderating factors. We then empirically test the model using a rich household dataset from the United Kingdom between 2012 and 2016. Our results show that SMT adoption is positively associated with energy-saving behaviors, while energysaving motivations substantially moderate this association—a lower level of concern about saving energy / a higher level of concern about climate change amplifies this effect. Importantly, we find that SMT usage positively moderates this relationship, but this marginal gain decreases in technology usage intensity. Our findings contribute to the information systems literature by showing a consequence of new technology adoption along with the role of cognitive dissonance in promoting intended objectives and identifying potential moderating effects. We discuss actionable insights for policymakers and utility firms.},

 abstract = {Information systems (IS) scholars have proposed guidelines for interpretive, mixed methods, and design science research in IS. Because many of these guidelines have also been suggested for evaluating what good or rigorous research is, they may be used as a checklist in the review process. In this paper, we raise the question: To what extent do research guidelines for interpretive, mixed methods, and design science research offer evidence that they can be used to evaluate the quality of research. We argue that scholars can use these guidelines to evaluate what good research is if there is compelling evidence that they lead to certain good research outcomes. We use three well-known sets of guidelines as examples and argue that they do not seem to offer evidence that we can use them to evaluate the quality of research. Instead, the “evidence” is often an authority argument, popularity, or examples demonstrating the applicability of the guidelines. If many research method principles we regard as authoritative in IS are largely based on speculation and opinion, we should take these guidelines less seriously in evaluating the quality of research. Our proposal does not render the guidelines useless. If the guidelines cannot offer cause-and-effect evidence for the usefulness of their principles, we propose viewing the guidelines as idealizations for pedagogical purposes, which means that reviewers cannot use these guidelines as checklists to evaluate what good research is. While our examples are from interpretive, mixed methods, and design science research, we urge the IS community to ponder the extent to which other research method guidelines offer evidence that they can be used to evaluate the quality of research.},

 abstract = {While most studies on digital financial inclusion highlight its positive aspects, we focus on the surveillance phenomenon by investigating the role played by microcredit agents who operate digital financial platforms. We combine the concepts of surveillance capitalism and platform capitalism within the digital financial inclusion process and propose a surveilled inclusion model that considers the role of human agents interacting with clients to expand the network effects and control of the digital platform in a dialectic interplay. We combine an instrumental/in-depth case study and critical hermeneutics as methodological strategies to produce results that help to uncover the hidden agenda of social fintech organizations that use digital platforms to provide microcredit. In addition, we expand Zuboff’s concept of surveillance capitalism by including the role of microcredit agents who reinforce the imprisonment of clients in endless cycles of payment and credit renewal.},

Via a design science research approach, we build and evaluate a sophisticated software system for the online provision of psychosocial healthcare to distributed and vulnerable populations. Multidisciplinary research capabilities are embedded within the system to investigate the effectiveness of online treatment protocols. Throughout the development cycles of the system, we build an emergent design theory of scrutiny that applies a multi-layer protocol to support governance of privacy and accountability in sensitive online applications. The design goal is to balance stakeholder privacy protections with the need to provide for accountable interventions in critical and well-defined care situations. The research implications for the development and governance of online applications in numerous privacy-sensitive application areas are explored},

 abstract = {Qualitative synthesis research is an approach that consolidates the output of different qualitative studies to create new subject knowledge. Such work can help reveal more powerful explanations than that seen in a single study, thereby generating increased levels of understanding of a given phenomenon and greater research finding generalizability. Based on a review of the literature and a survey of qualitative researchers, we found that the information systems (IS) domain lacks a clear understanding of qualitative synthesis methods and, as a result, has largely failed to take advantage of this powerful, high-potential methodological opportunity. To address this shortcoming, this paper is the first to provide a rigorous overview of the full suite of 35 qualitative synthesis methods, as well as guidelines that include a three-tiered selection framework. By using the guidelines and framework in tandem, IS researchers are able to select the qualitative synthesis method most appropriate for a given research study, particularly when the research objective involves knowledge integration/aggregation, interpretation/theory development, and/or informing IS practice.},

@article{SohSetia2022,
 abstract = {Multi-establishment firms (MEFs) rely on digitized processes enabled by advanced IT infrastructure; however, environmental dynamism is a major influence on their operations. Environmental dynamism threatens the efficacy of current operations, requiring firms to evolve their processes. Firms’ IT infrastructure may catalyze or hinder their endeavors and performance as they respond to environmental dynamics. Little previous research has examined which IT infrastructure types are high-performing and whether their effects vary across environments. We investigate the impacts of IT infrastructure, examining microlevel implementation—the constitution of technical and human assets—across the establishments of a multi-establishment firm (MEF). Specifically, we use the notion of a dominant IT infrastructure to unravel the heterogeneity of IT infrastructure across establishments. We explore dominant IT infrastructures—technology, human, or both—and assess their impacts across environmental conditions. To test our hypotheses, we used a panel dataset from 2007 to 2009 comprising 355 unique firms. Our findings reveal that the impact of establishment-level IT infrastructure types on MEF performance is contingent on environmental dynamism. A technology-dominant IT infrastructure leads to greater MEF performance in less dynamic environments, while a human-dominant IT infrastructure leads to greater MEF performance in more dynamic environments. The MEF performance is enhanced through a combination of technology- and human-dominant IT infrastructures in more dynamic environments. We conclude by discussing the theoretical insights and managerial implications of our findings.},

@article{SohYeowQiEtAl2023,
 abstract = {Although the pace of digital transformation (DT) has been accelerating in more organizations, there is still much uncertainty about the ways organizations can achieve the intended outcomes from such efforts. Rather than just focusing on the transformation outcomes, our paper suggests that a more fruitful approach would be to conceptualize DT as a journey that often encounters contradictory tensions. We adopt paradox theory to explain the dynamics through which organizations can manage these tensions while driving their DT efforts. Drawing on extensive review of the DT literature and preexisting research cases of three organizations’ experiences with the DT process, we developed the concept of DT pathways. DT pathways are the varied journeys experienced by organizations as they make strategic shifts - leveraging digital technology and evolving the organization’s business model. We show how DT pathways emerge as organizations adopt different DT strategic intent, actions, and responses to a range of paradoxical tensions. We outline three potential pathways—virtuous, moderate virtuous, and vicious DT pathways—and their attending predictive propositions, which can serve as a guide for managers and researchers involved in DT efforts and research.},

@article{SomehWixomDavernEtAl2023,
 abstract = {To realize value from their wealth of digital data, organizations are investing in data-driven organizational initiatives—efforts in which they must draw expertise in data, algorithms, and visualization together with knowledge and skills in business domains such as marketing and human resources. However, they face the challenge of crossing the knowledge divide between analytics groups and business groups. Exploring relationships between the two groups in 37 data-driven organizational initiatives, we develop a configuration-based model that explains analytics and businessdomain knowledge integration through the lens of synergy. Our configurational analyses revealed five configurations of relationships between the two, which bring about two distinct change outcomes: “dedicated data groups” and “multidisciplinary teams” lead to the emergence of new datadriven ways to work, and “analytics institutionalization,” “analytics resource optimization,” and “networked communities” produce convergence, through the sharing of data-driven ways to work. Each configuration displays a distinct element of the core processes identified (“developing group connectedness,” “exchanging analytics and business domain knowledge,” and “incentivizing organizational data use”) and yields either an emergence or convergence of data-driven ways of working. The findings demonstrate how data-driven organizational initiatives can benefit from a pervasive form of organizing that entwines analytics groups and business groups such that their members’ tools, mindsets, and behaviors are merged to profoundly change ways of working. Together, these findings and the configurational methodology used provide a nuanced picture of how organizations integrate the requisite specialist knowledge across domains to realize value from data.},

 abstract = {Ecosystems in highly regulated sectors such as banking are orchestrated through institutional policies and technical standards that ensure the interoperability of cloud service infrastructures. Despite such interoperability, actors must still coordinate distributed data control to guarantee that data are treated under equal conditions. Drawing on a case study of the Italian banking sector between 2009 and 2020, we investigate the coordination efforts of ecosystem actors in distributing data control across organizational boundaries and jurisdictions. We show that, despite the availability of interoperability standards, the distribution of data control creates tensions that, on the one hand, hinder integration efforts and, on the other hand, allow disproportionate value capture, together contributing to ecosystem failures. We introduce a process model that details how contractual and procedural coordination mechanisms can mitigate these tensions and facilitate value co-creation. We conclude with a discussion of the contributions and implications of our findings for further research on data control coordination.},

 abstract = {We study the problem of clinician well-being, through the lens of burnout, using an alternate source of data—a large, unstructured, publicly available dataset comprising 55,441 reviews written by clinicians on Glassdoor.com from 2012 to 2020. First, we employed topic mining and qualitative coding methods to identify contributing factors to clinician well-being and drew comparisons with electronic health records (EHR), a well-studied yet controversial factor in clinician burnout. Surprisingly, EHR- or IT-related keywords were not prominent in the clinicians’ discourse. Instead, routine operations emerged as the most frequently mentioned topic in the pros and cons sections of the reviews. Since routine operational issues are influenced by IT use, we leveraged organizational routines theory and application integration theory to propose a midrange “routines theory of employee well-being” that explains how managing organizational routines through IS can help improve clinician well-being. We tested the proposed theory using econometric models and found that integrating workflow applications significantly enhanced clinician well-being. In contrast, integrating documentation applications did not exhibit a significant impact. Interestingly, we also observed that the effects of integrating workflow and integrating documentation were more pronounced in hospitals with higher ratings of work-life balance or lower patient-to-nurse ratios, highlighting the critical role of staffing levels in driving the impact of EHR integration on clinician well-being. Overall, this is the first study to theorize and unravel the latent, intricate relationship between EHR and clinician burnout, which is moderated by organizational factors such as work-life balance policies and staffing levels.},

@article{SteinLimTan2022,
 abstract = {Online communities (OCs) have become an increasingly prevalent way for organizations to bring people together to collaborate and create value. However, despite the abundance of extant literature, many studies still point to the lack of long-term sustainability of OCs. We contend that communities become dormant or obsolete over time because of manifestations of ineffectiveness a state of the community that hinders the attainment of individual and collective desired outcomes. While ineffectiveness in OCs is common, it is less apparent why such ineffectiveness persists. Two knowledge gaps are particularly significant here. First, while the multilevel nature of OCs is acknowledged, corresponding difficulties in aligning individual and collective interests and behaviors have often been neglected in past studies. Second, rare longitudinal studies have revealed that community members respond to ineffectiveness with various coping behaviors. However, the impact of these coping behaviors may not turn out as desired. Consequently, we investigate the persistence of ineffectiveness from the perspective of multilevel and coping effects, addressing the following research question: How and why does ineffectiveness persist in online communities? Our critical realist case study offers a three-step explanatory framework: (1) underlying multilevel tensions in the community contribute to usage ineffectiveness (i.e., members are unable to use the OC effectively); (2) misguided coping behaviors contribute to ineffective adaptation (i.e., members are unable to cope with not being able to use the OC effectively); and (3) ineffectiveness persists due to the interaction between usage and adaptation ineffectiveness.},

@article{StoreyPark2022,
 abstract = {Sentiment analysis is used to mine text data from many sources, including blogs, support forums, and social media, in order to extract customers’ opinions and attitudes. The results can be used to make important assessments about a customer’s attitude toward a company and if and how a company should respond. However, much research on sentiment analysis uses simple classification, where the polarity of a text that is mined is classified as positive, negative, or neutral. This research creates an ontology of emotion process to support sentiment analysis, with an emphasis on obtaining a more fine-grained assessment of sentiment than polarity. The ontology is grounded in a theory of emotion process and consists of concepts that capture the generation of emotion all the way from the occurrence of an event to the resulting behaviors of the person expressing the sentiment. It includes two lexicons: one for affect and one for appraisal. The ontology is applied to posts obtained from customer support forums of large companies to show its applicability in a multilevel evaluation. Doing so provides an example of a complete ontology assessment effort.},

 abstract = {Members of mobile app design teams collaborate with each other to accomplish tasks and/or to socialize. However, how network configuration of instrumental and expressive interactions affects team creativity, efficiency, and satisfaction has not yet been studied. Accounting for both simplex and multiplex social networks in teams, this study develops a research model examining the mechanisms by which the centralization of different types of networks impacts team performance. To test our research hypotheses, we collected data from 62 student teams working on an app design class project. We found that the centralization of the instrumental-expressive multiplex network reduces teams’ information elaboration and similarity perception; the centralization of the instrumental simplex network is beneficial to information elaboration; and team information elaboration positively influences team creativity, efficiency, and satisfaction. We also found that team similarity perception negatively affects team creativity and positively affects team satisfaction. To alleviate concerns about the potential simultaneity bias between network configuration and information elaboration or similarity perception, we replicated the results based on a cross-lagged analysis with additional data collected from 48 design teams at two points: at team establishment and at project completion. This paper contributes to the literature on software development by examining the mechanisms via which the configuration of multiplex and simplex networks affects team performance.},

 abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) systems in the workplace increasingly substitute for employees’ tasks, responsibilities, and decision-making. Consequently, employees must relinquish core activities of their work processes without the ability to interact with the AI system (e.g., to influence decision-making processes or adapt or overrule decision-making outcomes). To deepen our understanding of how substitutive decision-making AI systems affect employees’ professional role identity and how employees adapt their identity in response to the system, we conducted an in-depth case study of a company in the area of loan consulting. We qualitatively analyzed more than 60 interviews with employees and managers. Our research contributes to the literature on IS and identity by disclosing mechanisms through which employees strengthen and protect their professional role identity despite being unable to directly interact with the AI system. Further, we highlight the boundary conditions for introducing an AI system and contribute to the body of empirical research on the potential downsides of AI.},

@article{SullivanWambaDunaway2023,
 abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the enabling technologies of Industry 4.0. Although IoT has shown great promise for organizations, its practical use in generating value alone or in combination with existing IT capabilities remains unclear. Drawing upon the literature on dynamic capabilities and innovation capability, we propose IoT-enabled innovation capability (IoT-IC), consisting of three dimensions (IoT use for sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring) to explain competitive advantage. We examine three ordinary IT capabilities (flexible IT infrastructure, IT business experience, and relationship infrastructure) as the predictors of IoT-IC. We also test the moderating effect of competitive aggressiveness in influencing the relationship between IoT-IC and competitive advantage. Analysis of survey data from 175 U.S. companies provides empirical support for our research model. The results suggest that flexible IT infrastructure, IT business experience, and relationship infrastructure are positively associated with IoT-IC. Furthermore, the effect of IoT-IC on competitive advantage is positively moderated by competitive aggressiveness. The results point to the important role of existing IT capabilities in shaping IoT-IC and expand our understanding of the relationship between IoT-IC and competitive advantage at different levels of competitive aggressiveness.},

@article{SuLuoLiEtAl2025,
 abstract = {Social media platforms such as Facebook and WeChat are fiercely competing for a limited pool of social media ad revenue. One pivotal competing battlefield revolves around populating their platforms with compelling and engaging content to increase user stickiness. Until now, extant literature has offered scant insights into potential differences in content-sharing preferences in a multiplatform context and underlying motivations and intricacies. To advance this line of research, this paper contextualizes and extends the self-presentation theory to unveil how the sharing of vice versus virtue content systematically varies with the strength of relationships (tie strength). This intricate phenomenon is meticulously examined through a field study across two distinct social media platforms and three carefully designed laboratory experiments. Notably, we found that social media users lean toward sharing vice content with their strong ties out of the desire to be liked, while they opt for virtue content with their weak ties to fulfill their desire for respect. Ushering in a supplementary layer of complexity, our research unveils online social exclusion as a pervasive yet often overlooked moderating force that challenges the fundamental assumption of self-presentation theory and defines its boundary condition. The findings of this study also carry important implications for social media companies to design effective measures to nurture engaging user content and for general businesses to make better digital marketing decisions.},

 abstract = {This research investigates virtual reality presentation (VR), revealing its impact on users’ mental models and mindful decision-making. We identify two fundamental features of VR: interactive viewing and depth cues. Through the lens of mental model theory, we explore how these two features shape users’ mental models and subsequently influence their mindfulness in decision-making. Two lab experiments were conducted to examine our research model. Study 1 examines interactive viewing and depth cues separately to assess their distinct impacts on the key components of users’ mental models—perceived control and acquired information. Study 2 employs an integrated VR presentation technology (i.e., Meta Quest 2) to explore the overall effect of VR presentations on users’ mental models and mindful decision-making. Results largely support our hypotheses. This research highlights the unique effects of VR presentation and its features, emphasizing enhanced user control and information acquisition in fostering high-quality mental models that increase mindfulness in users’ decisions in the online environment. These findings have significant implications for both research and practice of VR presentations.},

@article{SutantoWenningerDuriana2021a,
 abstract = {This paper investigates how platform design features affect the funding motivation of Muslim users on loan-based crowdfunding platforms. Theoretically grounded in Andreoni’s warm-glow giving theory and Sober and Wilson’s model of evolutionary and psychological giving, this work has high practical relevance, given the increasing demand for Islamic financial products. Loan-based crowdfunding platforms are important to the unique context of this research since Islamic religious constraints regulate monetary transactions involving lending. We used a scenario-based survey developed on the basis of a pilot study and confirmed by our manipulation check. The results show that “hedonism” represented by monetary interest negatively affected Muslim users’ willingness to engage in a loan-based crowdfunding project. This finding challenges the commonly agreed-upon egoistic motivator for loan-based crowdfunding platforms (i.e., monetary interest), which is based on Western Christian and Chinese Confucian capitalist economic and financial paradigms. Remarkably, we also found that Muslim funders’ level of willingness to engage on the hedonistic platform had an exponentially positive effect on the amount of money that funders were willing to lend. By contrast, “warm-glow giving,” manifested as belonging to a community, had no effect on users’ engagement. Implications of these findings for theory and practice are discussed.},

@article{SyedSilva2023,
 abstract = {Social media has emerged as a powerful medium to organize and mobilize social movements. In particular, the connective action of social media builds associations and allows for the continuity of social movements. Yet there is a lack of research on how connective action emergent from social media messages sustains long-term social movements. Accordingly, in this study, we concentrate on Twitter messages related to Women’s March protests held in 2017, 2018, and 2019. Using an interpretive analysis followed by the topic modeling approach, we analyzed the tweets to identify the different types of messages associated with the movement. These messages were classified using a set of categories and subcategories. Furthermore, we conducted a temporal analysis of the message (sub)categories to understand how distinct messages allow movement continuity beyond a specific protest march. Results suggest that while most of the messages are used to motivate and mobilize individuals, the connective action tactics employed through messages sent before, during, and after the marches allowed Women’s March to become a broader and more persistent movement. We advance theoretical propositions to explain the sustainability of a long-term social movement on social media, exemplified through large-scale connective action that persists over time. In doing so, this study contributes to connective action research by providing message categorization that synthesizes the meaning of message content. The findings could help social movement organizers learn different ways to frame messages that resonate with broader social media users. Moreover, our approach to analyzing a large set of tweets might interest other qualitative researchers.},

 abstract = {This study examines the important roles that human resources (HR) for information technology (IT) professionals and information systems (IS) practices for all workers in an organization play in shaping returns on firms’ IT investments. In particular, we consider how incentives, autonomy, and training for IT professionals can enable a firm to better leverage the value of its IT investments. We argue that well-trained, motivated, and empowered IT professionals can help firms make better strategic choices in allocating IT investments and implementing IT projects. We also demonstrate how this moderating relationship depends upon collaborative IS and autonomy-enhancing IS practices that affect other knowledge workers in the firm. We leverage archival data for 228 firms with 736 firm-year observations and document two key findings. We find (1) that empowering HR practices for IT professionals positively moderate the effect of IT investments on firm performance, and (2) that the alignment between empowering HR practices for IT professionals and firm-wide collaborative IS practices enhances the value that firms derive from IT investments. Our results suggest that the business value of IT investments is linked to the rewards and opportunities offered to IT professionals, who have a pivotal role in the effective deployment of IT in organizations.},

@article{TanaBreidbachBurtonJonesEtAl2023,
 abstract = {Digital technologies are reshaping both organizations and our lives as members of society. The resulting changes are often referred to as “digital transformation” (DT)—a concept that has proven difficult to define and explain theoretically. This is especially true because the nature and scope of DT is evolving beyond clearly defined organizational boundaries. Today, information technology (IT) is becoming increasingly accessible and relevant for many more members of society, creating the potential for previously unseen transformations beyond organizations. Accordingly, new theoretical lenses are needed to explain how a broader set of social actors instigate and are affected by transformative change induced by IT. We conceptualize DT as collective social action, a novel lens that aims to expand the focus of DT research beyond organizations as its unit of analysis, with a complementary perspective centered on social actors, their actions, and their impact. We delineate a typology of digital transformation as collective social action that considers the locus of transformation (what?), types of social actor(s) (who?), and the underlying mechanisms (how?). Collectively, the four ideal types constitute a new theory to help apprehend, explain, and predict how DT as collective social action occurs within and outside formally defined organizational boundaries.},

 abstract = {Chatbots have been pervasively applied in online retailing to communicate with customers. However, attracting and converting customers with chatbots remains a challenge, and little is known about whether and how chatbots’ communication traits influence customer purchase intention. In this study, we draw on the stereotype content model to identify warmth and competence as two distinct traits of chatbot communication. Then, we employ interpersonal attraction theory to pinpoint perceived attraction as the underlying mechanism, where customer-chatbot similarity of communication trait plays a contingent role in shaping perceived attraction. Through a mixed methods design, we found that customers perceive higher attraction toward chatbots with the communication trait of competence, facilitating customer purchase intention. When the similarity of dyadic communication traits exists, we also found that customers perceive higher attraction toward chatbots with warmth. Our findings contribute to the literature on chatbot anthropomorphism and customer behavior. The study also provides practical insights into chatbot design for online retailing.},

@article{TarafdarSaunders2022,
 abstract = {Blue-collar remote and mobile workers (BC-RMWs) such as repair/installation engineers, delivery drivers, and construction workers, constitute a significant share of the workforce. They work away from a home or office work base at customer and remote work sites and are highly dependent on ICT for completing their work tasks. Low occupational well-being is a key concern regarding BC-RMWs. The objective of this research is to understand how BC-RMWs can use information and communication technology (ICT) to elevate their occupational well-being. Drawing from the job demands-job resources theoretical framework in occupational psychology, we theorize that the distinctive work characteristics faced by BC-RMWs can be viewed in the conceptual framing of job demands. We conceptualize BC-RMWs’ practices of ICT use as possible ways to gather resources to tackle these demands. We conducted a study of 28 BC-RMWs employed in two private sector firms (telecom service provision and construction industries) in the UK across 14 remote work sites. Based on our findings, we developed the concept of ICT-enabled job crafting and theorized how ICT-enabled job crafting by BC-RMWs can help them increase their job resources to tackle their job demands and consequently increase their occupational well-being. The empirical context of the paper, i.e., the study of BC-RMWs, provides further novelty because these kinds of workers and their distinctive and interesting work conditions have not received much attention in the literature.},

Based on a synthesis of existing literature, we discuss the interplay between IS and resilience, as examined by various streams of research, and consolidate these insights under the banner of “digital resilience.” Our exploration culminates in a new conceptual framework of digital resilience from which we formulate avenues for future research. Through this work, we aim to encourage and support further research and practical strategies focused on digital resilience, ultimately strengthening our collective capacity to navigate the diverse disruptions of our shared future.},

@article{TrinkleWarkentinMalimageEtAl2021a,
 abstract = {Extant research has shown that neutralization processes can enable potential IS security policy violators to justify their behavior and overcome the deterrence effect of sanctions in order to engage in unethical behaviors. However, such sanctions are typically moderate and not career ending. We test the boundary conditions of this theory by evaluating whether neutralization plays a role in overcoming the impact of extreme levels of deterrence. We extend the Siponen and Vance (2010) framework within a professional context that assigns extreme sanctions to violators. Using the scenario-based factorial survey method common in IS security research, we collected data from future auditors who understand these extreme sanctions. We test the reasons that auditors may use to form intentions to falsify information concerning an information security issue with a company’s accounting information system, thereby jeopardizing data integrity and security by modifying working papers to hide irregularities and, by doing so, violating their professional standards, which could result in career-ending sanctions. We empirically validated and tested the theoretical model. Our results show that sanctions play an important role in reducing employees’ intentions to violate policy but that, even under extreme boundary conditions, employees might seek to rationalize their unethical behavior by denying responsibility for their actions through, for example, arguing that their supervisors pressured them into performing the violations. We also establish that messages heightening the awareness and perceptions of the certainty and severity of organizational punishment are likely to attenuate such deviant behaviors. We discuss the implications of these findings and suggest future avenues for research.},

@article{TsaiPai2021a,
 abstract = {Both scholars and practitioners recognize the importance of newcomers’ contribution behavior in online social groups. However, extant research has largely focused on existing members’ behavior, leaving the issue of newcomers’ contribution behavior relatively unexplored. This research proposes a theoretical framework for understanding why newcomers engage in contribution processes, how group engagement leads to normative pressure, and whether normative pressure has curvilinear effects on information contributions. Drawing on the theory of engagement, we propose that newcomer group engagement, characterized by vigor, dedication, and absorption, exerts dual effects on information contributions. We also argue that newcomers who personally engage in contribution processes tend to reveal three key psychological conditions: meaningfulness (i.e., a sense of return on investments of the self in contribution processes), safety (i.e., a sense of being able to show and express oneself without fear of negative consequences), and availability (i.e., a sense of readiness to engage personally in contribution processes). We further investigate a focal antecedent for each psychological condition. Using multisource data collected at three points in time, this research finds that value congruence, perceived group support, and contribution self-efficacy positively influence newcomer group engagement, which in turn leads to greater information contribution behaviors. This study also shows that greater group engagement can initiate a spiral of social role expectations, leading to heightened levels of normative pressure. Moreover, normative pressure has an inverted U-shaped relationship with information contribution behavior. These findings offer both theoretical and practical implications.},

@article{TsekourasLiFrickEtAl2024,
 abstract = {Firms increasingly use consumer information to target and personalize communication with consumers. This paper focuses on explicit targeting, a practice where firms saliently (yet subtly) reveal the information used to target consumers in their advertisement text. How to craft ad messages to convey product benefits without triggering privacy concerns is a nontrivial task. Results from a field experiment reveal that consumers respond negatively to explicit targeting, yet such a negative effect can be partially alleviated by using hedonic instead of utilitarian information framing. In a controlled online experiment, we show that explicit targeting increases consumers’ privacy concerns relative to the perceived benefits of personalization, leading to less positive consumer responses. Interestingly, an extension of the online experiment suggests that providing consumers with a clear description of why they are targeted seems to offset the negative effects of explicit targeting. This study offers important academic implications for the personalization literature and valuable practical insights for firms and policymakers.},

@article{TurelBechara2024,
 abstract = {There is a growing trend to accept, understand and cater to people with heterogenous mental health levels, as captured by the term “neurodiversity.” Population studies demonstrate growth in neurodiversity facets such as depression, anxiety, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Thus, samples of information systems (IS) users are likely neurodiverse. While studies started examining neurodiversity effects mostly in professional contexts, possible effects of IS users’ neurodiversity in leisure settings have been largely overlooked. Here, we suggest that we need to consider such possible effects more systematically. This is important because neurodiversity facets can manifest in changes in cognitive-emotional processing, social reactions, and decision-making which can alter user responses to IS. Thus, ignoring the neurodiversity of users can affect the accuracy and generalizability of user behavior models; it can disadvantage large segments of users. To support these ideas, we first developed a theoretical model that explains how neurodiversity can affect the decision-making of IS users. Next, we conducted three studies (n1 = 400, n2 = 381, and n3 = 280) that first replicated common IS models in leisure settings and then theoretically and empirically integrated neurodiversity facets into these models. Results show that (1) typical IS user samples are neurodiverse, and (2) integrating neurodiversity facets into user behavior models can be informative, lead to greater inclusivity, and afford more nuanced theoretical and practical insights. Thus, we call for a more systematic inclusion of neurodiversity facets in behavioral IS research.},

 abstract = {In the last decade, online social networks have become an integral part of life. These networks play an important role in the dissemination of news, individual communication, disclosure of information, and business operations. Understanding the structure and implications of these networks is of great interest to both academia and industry. However, the unstructured nature of the graphs and the complexity of existing network analysis methods limit the effective analysis of these networks, particularly on a large scale. In this research, we propose a simple but effective node embedding method for the analysis of graphs with a focus on its application in online social networks. Our proposed method not only quantifies social graphs in a structured format but also enables user preference identification, community detection, and link prediction in online social networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using a network of Twitter users. The results of this research provide valuable insights for marketing professionals seeking to target personalized content and advertising to individual users as well as social network administrators seeking to improve their platform through recommendation systems and the detection of outliers and anomalies.},

 abstract = {The migration to electronic health records (EHR) in the healthcare industry has raised issues with respect to security and privacy. One issue that has become a concern for healthcare providers, insurance companies, and pharmacies is patient health information (PHI) leaks because PHI leaks can lead to violation of privacy laws, which protect the privacy of individuals’ identifiable health information, potentially resulting in a healthcare crisis. This study explores the issue of PHI leaks from an access control viewpoint. We utilize access control policies and PHI leak scenarios derived from semi structured interviews with four healthcare practitioners and use the lens of activity theory to articulate the design of an access control model for detecting and mitigating PHI leaks. Subsequently, we follow up with a prototype as a proof of concept.},

@article{VanOschBulgurcuLiang2023a,
 abstract = {Transparency—the observability of activities, behaviors, and performance—is often treated as a panacea for modern management. Yet there is a conundrum in the literature, with some studies suggesting that transparency may benefit group creativity and others suggesting that privacy may do so. A similar conundrum exists regarding the effects of different social capital types—structural holes vs. network cohesion—on group creativity. Enterprise social media (ESM) provide a unique opportunity to solve these conundrums by allowing groups to be “transparent” (non-group members can observe and/or participate in group activities) or “private” (group members and activities are hidden from the community) and enabling groups to develop distinct social capital structures. Using data from 28,083 written interactions produced by 109 transparent and 106 private groups in an ESM of a multinational design firm, we found strong support for our contingency hypotheses that both transparent and private groups may produce high levels of creative dialogues, yet in different forms. Specifically, expansion-focused creative dialogues— those focused on combining or expanding existing concepts—emerge in transparent groups, but only when the group’s social capital is characterized by structural holes. Conversely, we found that reframingfocused dialogues—those focused on challenging and rethinking—emerge in private groups but only when the group’s social capital is characterized by network cohesion. Theoretically, these findings can help to solve the conundrums in the literature on group creativity and shed light on the role of ESM use in this context. Practically, our findings offer a critical reflection o contemporary initiatives for increasing transparency, whether through physical design or digital transformation.},

 abstract = {We address the problem of recommending online communities on social media platforms using design science. Our method is grounded in network science and leverages the random surfer model of the web, small-world networks, strength of weak connections, and connectivity to analyze three types of large-scale networks. In doing so, we design features for structural hole assortativity and local clustering coefficient rank to capture both the diversity and evolution of user interests. We also extract general online community features such as size and overlap. Experiments conducted on a large dataset of 34,000 lists created and subscribed to by 1,600 active Twitter users over a six-month period showed that our network features outperform the general and content features in terms of recommending communities at the top position. In addition, a combination of general and network features generated the best results in the top position with a significant performance improvement over using only the content features. A combination of all three types of features gave the best results in the top-5 and top-10 positions while improving the quality of recommendations at every other position. Our work outperforms the latest work on community recommendations on social media platforms and has major implications for the design of online community recommenders.},

@article{VenkateshSpeierPeroAljafariEtAl2022,
 abstract = {As information technology (IT) continues to be an integral yet evolving component in work settings, organizations need to ensure that they realize value from IT. Prior studies examining the post-adoption consequences of IT use in terms of employee job outcomes have been inconclusive with respect to the magnitude and direction of these impacts—i.e., the positive, negative, and nonsignificant impacts of IT use on job outcomes. The question of under what conditions IT use leads to favorable job outcomes over time thus remains largely unanswered. We develop a model of IT-related contingencies that integrates core constructs from the IT adoption research with two key job outcomes: job satisfaction and job performance. We hypothesize that in the post-adoption phase, technology-job fit is a key moderator of the relationships between IT use for supporting sales operations and job outcomes. Further, we suggest a theoretical extension of the classical predictors of IT adoption—perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use—as we expect them to moderate the effect of IT use on job performance over time. We tested our model in a longitudinal field study among 295 field sales personnel over a 24-month period. We found that although IT use had a negative effect on job satisfaction during the post-adoption phase, this effect was moderated by technology-job fit such that the negative effect was significantly attenuated by technology-job fit. We also found that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and technology-job fit enhanced the positive effect of IT use on job performance. Our findings offer insights into the mechanisms and conditions related to the post-adoption impacts of IT use on key job outcomes.},

@article{VenkateshWengRaiEtAl2023,
 abstract = {The use of multilevel analysis has steadily increased in information systems (IS) research. Many studies are doing an admirable job of integrating two-level models into their examination of IS phenomena. However, two-level models are limited in how well they enable researchers to (1) more explicitly incorporate context into theory development and testing and (2) bridge the existing gap between micro- and macrolevel research by focusing on intervening mechanisms that link hierarchically distal levels of analysis. Three-level models have emerged as a potential way to address these limitations. While the literature has clearly outlined the mechanics of how to estimate three-level models, there is very little, if any, guidance on when and how to integrate the use of such models with theory development. Consequently, IS researchers have little guidance to inform their decisions about integrating the use of three-level models with their theory development and testing. In this article, we identify the circumstances under which IS researchers should consider the use of three-level models, develop guidelines about how to map the use of three-level model estimation to the theoretical objectives, and provide an illustration of how to implement the guidelines.},

@article{ViragBernroiderRemus2024,
 abstract = {Agile information systems development (ISD) projects face the dilemma of control versus autonomy. Although autonomy benefits agile ISD, many projects in practice nevertheless feature project managers who exert control for more formal structure and guidance. To address this autonomy-control dilemma, prior research on traditional ISD highlights the need for control ambidexterity, which is the simultaneous execution of contrasting control activities. However, little is known about achieving control ambidexterity in agile ISD projects, and, in particular, how agile project managers dynamically adapt controls to changing contextual requirements. Our in-depth case study in the IT department of a multinational container shipping company that runs several Scrum ISD projects identifies four agile project management styles (Landscaper, Buddy, Detective, and Commander) and associated balanced practices for control ambidexterity. We also show how agile project managers blend or shift their styles in response to conflicts, revealing different levels of adherence to agile development principles. We contribute to the ISD control literature by reflecting on different forms of contextual and temporal control ambidexterity and theorizing how the interplay between control conflicts and underlying factors leads to varied ambidexterity forms. Furthermore, our insights suggest signaling theory should complement agency and stewardship theories to better understand agile ISD control.},

@article{VoPlachkinovaVEtAl2023,
 abstract = {The main purpose of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 was to provide more uniformity in sentencing and reduce interjudge disparity. Subsequently, the act created the federal sentencing guidelines to offer judges a possible sentencing range for offenses. However, since these recommendations were based on historical data, the guidelines amplified existing biases and increased inequality and the disproportionate sentencing of minorities. To address this problem, we developed an artifact called “ShowCase”—a data-driven dashboard—that is grounded in penal theory, organizational context theory, social bonds theory, and triangulation notion in design theory. The artifact helps judges make fairer and more objective decisions by integrating a variety of data points. We used a design science research methodology and mixed methods to guide the development and evaluation of the proposed dashboard. Our research inquiry revealed the legal and extralegal factors that contribute to more equitable judicial decisions. We also found support for integrating data science and more diverse viewpoints in the sentencing process. Our study shows that a validated data-driven dashboard can be used to promote fairness, objectivity, and transparency in the criminal justice system.},

@article{WangDurcikovaDennisEtAl2023,
 abstract = {Information security is a multilevel phenomenon with employee security decisions being influenced by macrolevel factors (e.g., organizational policies), mesolevel factors (e.g., one’s immediate workgroup—IW), and microlevel factors (e.g., individual personalities). We argue that an employee’s local IW (i.e., immediate supervisor and coworkers) has a strong effect on security. This paper focuses on the effects of these mesolevel factors in the presence of macro- and microlevel factors. Drawing on the social structure and social learning framework as well as workgroup research, we hypothesize that the security behavior of an employee’s IW supervisor and coworkers moderated by the nature of these relationships influences information security decisions. Our research, based on a sample of 217 full-time employees, reveals that the IW significantly affects security decisions, over and above the micro- and macrolevel factors. These effects are moderated by the nature of the relationship between employees and their IW supervisor (leader-member exchange) and coworkers (team-member exchange). A post hoc analysis shows that the mesolevel factors alone had the same explanatory power as the micro- and macrolevels combined. Our research suggests that future theory and research should include the IW and that organizations should share security responsibilities with line managers and help them understand their substantial impact on information security. Security training programs should ask employees about the behaviors of their IW supervisor and coworkers and, where needed, deliver anti-neutralization training to mitigate the effects of the IW’s noncompliance behaviors.},

@article{WangHuLiangEtAl2025,
 abstract = {Although IT ambidexterity can improve organizational agility and firm performance, limited attention has been paid to how it is developed. This article theoretically elaborates and empirically examines the effects of two types of communication modes between the chief information officer and the top management team, formal mutual communication (FMC) and informal mutual communication (IFMC), on IT ambidexterity, or the proportional balance between IT exploitation and IT exploration and how these effects vary across organizational and environmental contexts. Based on fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis of the survey data from 256 dyads of business and IT executives from the Chinese shipbuilding industry, we found that all configurations for achieving IT ambidexterity are observed in dynamic environments where both FMC and IFMC can play enabling roles, depending on the specific firm size. In addition, both modes can serve as enablers of IT exploitation. While IFMC always enables IT exploration, FMC may be irrelevant in some contexts or even counterproductive in other contexts. This paper expands the literature on IT ambidexterity by investigating FMC and IFMC as its antecedents, which makes a significant contribution to both IS research and practice.},

 abstract = {Although workforce diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) have been recognized as essential components in healthcare organizations, robust empirical research is scarce on how workforce DEI influences patient safety outcomes, particularly concerning the boundary conditions that may moderate this relationship. This study analyzes a longitudinal dataset from 2017 to 2021 that includes DEI metrics, staff-reported patient safety incidents, and employee feedback on DEI from Glassdoor and Indeed for 120 NHS Trusts in England’s acute care sector. We examine workforce DEI through both its demographic and experiential dimensions to provide a comprehensive view. Employing a double machine learning approach, our findings indicate that a one-unit increase in workforce DEI scores is associated with a reduction of 8.108 patient safety incidents per 1000 admissions. Moreover, regions with greater patient racial diversity and healthcare organizations with lower complexity experience significantly greater benefits from DEI initiatives. This study provides healthcare policymakers and institutions with actionable insights to strategically tailor DEI initiatives and effectively improve patient safety.},

Drawing on the elaboration likelihood model, we propose that signals from campaigns (videos) and creators (experience) can mitigate information asymmetry concerns about project quality and creator credibility and that creator-originating signals offset the effect of campaign-originating signals on crowdfunding success. Further, we posit that online communication between creators and backers (backer comments and creator replies) complements or substitutes for the effects of signals originating from the campaign or creator. We collected and analyzed objective data on 9,884 crowdfunding projects from a major reward-based crowdfunding platform in China and were able to confirm most of our hypotheses.},

 abstract = {The turnover of IT professionals is a perpetual challenge for non-IT organizations. Based on self-categorization theory, this study proposes that IT employees’ turnover may be mitigated by fostering their identification with non-IT organizations, which can be done by meeting various facilitative conditions. Guided by intergroup contact theory, we identify IT employees’ perceived alignment between IT and the core business of an organization (business-IT alignment), the extent of boundary-spanning activities that IT employees engage in, and the closeness of the relationships between IT and non-IT employees as the drivers of their organizational identification. Using survey data collected from organizations in different industries, we obtained empirical evidence supporting the positive effects of the perceived business-IT alignment, the extent of boundary-spanning activities, and the relationship closeness between IT and non-IT employees on IT employees’ organizational identification. Additionally, there was a three-way interaction effect among the three drivers such that the relationship closeness between IT and non-IT employees reduced the positive effect of the extent of boundary-spanning activities on IT employees’ organizational identification when business-IT alignment was low. However, this negative moderating effect diminished when business-IT alignment increased. The findings of this research advance the literature and offer practical guidelines for non-IT organizations on how to enhance their IT employees’ organizational identification and how to mitigate their turnover intentions.},

 abstract = {The rise of financial technology (fintech) has motivated practitioners and researchers to explore alternative data sources and enhanced credit scoring methods for better assessment of consumers’ credit risk. In this study, we examine whether deep-level diversity derived from consumers’ multimodal social media posts (i.e., alternative data) can enhance credit risk assessment or not. First, we propose novel lifestyle-based risk constructs (e.g., opinion risk) to capture consumers’ deep-level diversity. Second, we incorporate these lifestyle-based risk constructs into econometric models to empirically evaluate the relationship between consumers’ deep-level diversity and their credit risk. Using a credit scoring dataset provided by a fintech firm listed on Nasdaq, our econometric analysis reveals that consumers’ opinion risk constructs extracted from their multimodal social media posts are positively associated with their credit risk. Furthermore, our results show that the proposed opinion risk constructs can significantly improve the effectiveness of predicting consumers’ credit risk. Interestingly, our empirical results also show that combining the opinion risk constructs derived from images and text can significantly improve the effectiveness in credit risk prediction. This work contributes to the fintech domain by proposing novel lifestyle-based risk constructs for decision support in the credit scoring context.},

 abstract = {We develop principles that facilitate socially inclusive design-oriented research with marginalized groups. Building on the recognition that the research process must be informed by theoretical perspectives about social inclusion, our effort begins with an empirical investigation of a multiyear research project that designed several IT-based solutions for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. We treat the efforts to design each solution as a “case,” capture primary data from multiple sources, and analyze it in light of three facets of social inclusion drawn from prior work: self-determination, belongingness, and social capital. The findings are interpreted to derive five principles for a socially inclusive design-oriented research process: (1) respecting multiperspective problem ownership and integrated solution design, (2) surfacing emic contributions to guide artifact design, (3) leveraging the support network to shape artifact design and refine research conduct, (4) customizing design-evaluate cycles with inclusive practices, and (5) pursuing authenticity in research collaborations. We elaborate each principle with connections to different facets of social inclusion, guidelines suggested by our empirical investigation, and a mapping against contemporary design-oriented research approaches. The five principles suggest key directions to facilitate a socially inclusive design-oriented research process when working with marginalized groups. The paper concludes with a discussion of implications for IS scholars, and pointers for using design-oriented approaches for greater social inclusion of marginalized populations.},

 abstract = {The transition to renewable energy requires organizations and governments to formulate and enact new energy policies. This emerging energy era is characterized by higher levels of supply and demand intermittency, which requires information systems to manage the electricity grid. We propose key policy elements for managing intermittency based on information systems to implement digital mirror actions for managing the production, consumption, and transfer of electricity and market mechanisms for maintaining grid equilibrium. This article discusses these and their energy policy implications.},

 abstract = {The peer review process is a mainstay for informing publication decisions at many journals and conferences. It has several strengths that are well-accepted, such as providing a signal about the quality of published papers. Nonetheless, it has several limitations that have been documented extensively, such as reviewer biases affecting paper appraisals. To date, attempts to mitigate these limitations have had limited success. Accordingly, I consider how developments in artificial intelligence technologies—in particular, pretrained large language models with downstream fine-tuning—might be used to automate peer reviews. I discuss several challenges that are likely to arise if these systems are built and deployed and some ways to address these challenges. If the systems are deemed successful, I describe some characteristics of a highly competitive, lucrative marketplace for these systems that is likely to emerge. I discuss some ramifications of such a marketplace for authors, reviewers, editors, conference chairs, conference program committees, publishers, and the peer review process.},

 abstract = {We develop a qualitative catastrophe (a nonlinear sudden violent change) multi-agent simulation model to investigate the evolution of group behavior, specifically abrupt changes in online impulsive buying (OIB) behavior. Studies have rarely investigated the mechanism of abrupt changes in OIB at the group level. To address the research gaps and advance this area of research, we employed a sequential multiple-methods approach. First, we designed a questionnaire to obtain and analyze consumer data to identify OIB drivers. Second, we built a qualitative catastrophe model based on empirical findings to describe sudden changes in the OIB behavior of individuals by merging catastrophe theory (CT) and qualitative simulation (QSIM). Finally, grounded in the qualitative catastrophe model, we constructed an agent-based model (ABM) to simulate group-level OIB behavior. The empirical findings revealed the following. (1) Sudden changes in group-level OIB occur as consumers’ sense of quantified self increases when self-control is low. (2) The greater the number of consumers with a proving preference (who prefer to prove their competence and performance to others) in the group, the higher the possibility of catastrophe; the scale of catastrophe increases significantly with the enhancement of product information features. (3) We identify optimal gamification for sudden increases in group-level OIB; the larger the degree of social networking is, the higher the likelihood of catastrophe behavior. Our proposed combination of a survey study, QSIM, and an ABM is a plausible solution for behavioral research on consumers, and the integration paradigm could help maintain market stability and promote products.},

@article{WuGuoWangEtAl2023,
 abstract = {Current online review systems widely suffer from rating biases. Biased ratings can lead to violations of customer trust and failures of business intelligence. Hence, both practitioners and researchers have directed massive efforts toward curbing rating biases. In this paper, we investigate bandwagon bias, the rating distortion resulting from individuals posting ratings shifted toward the displayed average rating, and propose a bias warning approach to mitigate this bias. Drawing on the flexible correction model, the theory of valuation in behavioral economics, and previous warning research, we design an effective warning strategy in two steps. First, we start with the risk-alert warning strategy, which prior research has widely employed, and rationalize its deficiencies by synthesizing theoretical analysis and extant empirical evidence. Second, considering the deficiencies, we identify a supplementary content design factor—the ranking task—and construct a risk-alert-with-ranking-task warning strategy. We then empirically test the effects of the two warning strategies on individual ratings in cases in which bandwagon bias either occurs or does not occur in individuals’ initial assessments. The results of four controlled experiments indicate that (1) the risk-alert strategy can reduce bandwagon bias in individual ratings but will elicit unwanted rating distortions when bandwagon bias does not occur in individuals’ initial assessments, and (2) the risk-alert-with-ranking-task strategy can mitigate bandwagon bias while avoiding the unwanted rating distortions above and can thus function as an effective warning strategy. Our research contributes to the literature by proposing an effective debiasing solution for bandwagon bias and a bias warning approach for online rating debiasing, which can help increase rating informativeness on online platforms.},

@article{WuTayiFengEtAl2021a,
 abstract = {To efficiently manage information security, firms typically outsource part of their security functions to a managed security service provider (MSSP) under a variety of contractual arrangements. Based on this practice, we study a business setting in which the management of security outsourcing depends on the security efforts of both the MSSP and its clients, taking into account that their allocation of efforts can change during the contract horizon. Since their efforts are private to each other, a double moral hazard (DMH) problem can arise with the use of bilateral refund contracts, which have been widely adopted in the MSSP industry. Moreover, both the high probability of undirected attacks and system interdependency can exacerbate the DMH problem. We propose two new types of contracts to solve this problem. One is a monitoring contract, in which a cyberinsurance firm monitors the security efforts of the MSSP and its clients. The other is a liability contract, in which both parties take full liability for breaches through rewarding clients who are well protected and penalizing clients who end up being breached by hackers. Our findings show that monitoring contracts can only solve the DMH problem when variable monitoring costs are negligible. Liability contracts can also solve the DMH problem and are worth implementing when an MSSP encounters (1) a high probability of undirected attack, (2) high system interdependency, (3) a long contract horizon, or (4) when both parties have nearly equal responsibility over the course of the contract horizon. We also compare the proposed contracts in two additional settings: when the MSSP has a spillover effect and when the MSSP serves three or more clients.},

@article{XuPhanTan2022,
 abstract = {Research has shown that many people use social networking sites (SNS) excessively, which may lead to various negative consequences. With the aim of reducing SNS addition, this study investigates the role of SNS characteristics in the formation of SNS addiction. By applying incentive sensitization theory in the context of SNS addiction, we suggest that the compulsive motivation for using an SNS is developed by pleasurable and rewarding SNS use experiences. Social network characteristics and communication characteristics, which determine the rewards that users obtain from SNS use, moderate the relationship between habitual SNS use and SNS addiction. We develop novel behavioral measures of habitual SNS use and SNS addiction based on SNS activity logs and empirically test the research model using a large and unique dataset. Besides contributing to the theoretical development of SNS addiction, the results of this study offer practical options to help prevent SNS addiction. Moreover, the measures of SNS addiction enable the automated monitoring of user behavior on SNS, which could be useful for detecting potential SNS addicts.},

 abstract = {Online gamified competition utilizes competition as a core gamification design element with affordances from wearables and mobile applications to track competitive activities and visualize information in an integrated way to shape users’ exercise behaviors. However, a clear understanding of how online gamified competition cultivates exercise behaviors in different types of individuals is still lacking. We take into account the individual differences in exercise behaviors and categorize exercisers into three groups (active, moderate, and inactive) based on an adapted recency, frequency, and monetary value framework using key exercise behavior metrics. Theorizing online gamified competition as a means of social and temporal self-comparison, we examine the effect of performance feedback from two distinct modes of comparison (performance rankings and performance gap), and participants’ relationships with their social comparison referents (i.e., rivalry intensity), on the exercise behaviors of different exerciser groups. Our results reveal that online gamified competition has differential effects on exercise behaviors across different exerciser groups. Specifically, we find that positive performance improvements are more motivational for active and moderate exercisers, while performance deterioration relative to historical exercise performance level is more discouraging for inactive exercisers. Performance rankings exhibit a more salient effect for moderate and inactive exercisers, and rivalry intensity has a stronger positive effect on active exercisers’ exercise behavior. The strengthening effect of awareness affordances in mobile fitness apps is more notable with regard to the impact of rivalry intensity on moderate and inactive exercisers. We derive theoretical and practical implications of gamified information systems that use competition as a core design element for shaping the exercise behavior of individuals in different exerciser groups.},

@article{YangLehmanWang2025,
 abstract = {Crowdfunding has become an important fundraising method for entrepreneurs. In this study, we examine the role of successful crowdfunding experiences in serial entrepreneurship. Although serial entrepreneurs are typically more mature and achieve higher success rates, it remains unclear how their success affects their subsequent crowdfunding performance, given the extant literature’s mixed views of crowdfunding experiences. To resolve this tension regarding the effects of crowdfunding success, we integrate insights from the crowdfunding literature with organizational learning theory to propose a research framework with competing hypotheses. On the one hand, the crowdfunding literature suggests a positive effect arising from the signaling of legitimacy and credibility from entrepreneurs’ prior success. On the other hand, organizational learning theory suggests the potential of a superstitious learning effect wherein entrepreneurs erroneously associate success with specific actions that may not contribute to success, thereby resulting in reduced subsequent performance. We further identify several moderators related to both theoretical perspectives. Empirical analysis of 10,795 crowdfunding campaigns from 3,978 serial entrepreneurs on Kickstarter suggests that successful experiences, on average, have a detrimental effect on the performance of subsequent campaigns. The results also suggest that experience relatedness, backing experience, and prior blockbuster success can mitigate this negative effect, whereas goal overshooting accentuates it. Supplementary analysis provides insights into the mechanisms at play, specifically, how the positive and negative aspects of success manifest. This study provides theoretical implications for the crowdfunding literature by addressing the tension inherent to crowdfunding success and offers guidance for crowdfunding entrepreneurs and platform operators.},

@article{YeKankanhalliTan2025,
 abstract = {The performance of solvers is crucial to the success of crowdsourcing contest platforms. Sustained solver performance entails a combination of exploration and exploitation activities, i.e., solver ambidexterity. However, it can be arduous for solvers to engage in ambidexterity with limited knowledge of what its optimal levels are and little research informing this topic. Thus, this study examines the relationship between solver ambidexterity and performance, which is stated to be positive for workers in organizational research. We challenge this assumption and propose that the costs associated with ambidexterity will limit its efficacy beyond a certain level—i.e., we hypothesize an inverted U-shaped relationship between ambidexterity and solver performance. Moreover, how contest conditions shape this relationship is unclear. Drawing on the bounded rationality model, we hypothesize three moderators of the relationship, i.e., task reward, task diversity, and in-process feedback. We tested our model using a panel dataset of solvers from a major crowdsourcing contest platform. Our results support the inverted U-shaped relationship between solvers’ ambidexterity and performance. We find that the highest-performing solver cluster showed a ratio of 5.33 exploitation activities to 1 exploration activity, contradicting the prior premise that both activities are required to a similar extent. Additionally, task diversity and task reward are found to steepen the inverted U curve, while in-process feedback flattens the curve. Our study contributes to theoretical knowledge of the relationship between solvers’ ambidexterity and performance and its contingent conditions. The results also offer novel insights for solvers and platforms to manage ambidexterity and the trade-offs between exploration and exploitation.},

@article{Yoo2024,
 abstract = {Scientific journals, crucial components of our epistemic infrastructure, have continuously adapted to the changing technological landscape. Today, we stand at the precipice of a transformative phase brought about by generative AI, specifically large language models such as OpenAI’s GPT and Google’s Bard. In this opinion piece, I examine the implications of these models for the future of scientific journals and various stakeholders in the scientific community, including journals, scholars, and universities. To envisage the future trajectory of scientific journals, it’s imperative to comprehend the operational mechanisms of these models and the fundamentally recombinatorial nature of human knowledge creation. I suggest that one of the significant roles generative AI can play is facilitating “long jumps” in our knowledge exploration process. I further propose decentralization and deferred and temporary binding as two crucial characteristics of the evolving epistemic infrastructure that supports precarious knowledge production. I foresee a future where scientific journals extend beyond their traditional gatekeeping roles. I call for scholars—as authors, reviewers, and mentors—to utilize these technologies to traverse the broad landscape of potential knowledge, fostering a more inclusive and dynamic scientific ecosystem.},

@article{YuanFengLiEtAl2022,
 abstract = {Considering a two-sided software platform with software developers on one side and software users on the other, we study whether the platform should adopt a penetration pricing strategy or skimming pricing strategy on the developer side. We propose a two-period analytical model with asymmetric cross-side network effects to analyze the platform’s optimal pricing strategy. Our analysis reveals that the platform should adopt a penetration pricing strategy if the user-to-developer network effect is strong and a skimming pricing strategy otherwise. If the platform does not charge users an access fee, the platform should consider subsidizing developers’ access in the first period only. However, when the platform charges users an access fee, subsidizing developers’ access in both periods can be viable for the platform. Charging the software user an access fee incentivizes the platform to subsidize developers in the first period if the user-to-developer network effect is weak. Finally, this study reveals that the optimal access fee charged or subsidy provided to developers in the two periods is determined by several key factors: developers’ basic expectations about the revenue to be gained from the platform (optimistic or pessimistic), intensities of cross-side network effects, the lengths of the two periods, and the access fee charged to users.},

@article{Zaitsev2025,
 abstract = {Content moderation on social media platforms, such as Facebook, plays a critical role in curating user-generated content by mitigating harmful, misleading, or inappropriate materials. Despite significant investments in both human and algorithmic moderation systems, platforms continue to struggle with effectively managing the vast and complex flow of content, often facing criticism from various user groups for perceived inconsistencies and failures. This paper provides a systems theory analysis of Facebook’s content moderation system, with a particular focus on its sociotechnical nature, where human and non-human actors interact to moderate content. Using the COVID-19 pandemic as a revelatory case study, this research explores the disruptions to Facebook’s moderation processes caused by external shocks and identifies key conflicts within the system. Through the lens of systems science, the study reveals several points of tension, including conflicting goals between stakeholders, breakdowns in communication, and the challenges posed by both human and algorithmic moderators. By understanding these conflicts, this paper offers insights into why content moderation continues to be a significant challenge for social media platforms and proposes recommendations for improving moderation efforts. This study contributes to the broader discourse on content moderation by demonstrating the value of applying systems theory to analyze and address the complexities of these sociotechnical systems.},

 abstract = {Energy and carbon management systems (ECMS) are a class of green information systems that has the potential to increase environmental sustainability in organizations and across supply chains. Employing a design science research approach, we define the scope of ECMS in the supply chain context, identify requirements, design an expository instantiation, and develop an information systems design theory, including key constructs and design principles. We instantiate this theory in four supply chain contexts to validate and revise the proposed design in two rounds. We identify six system components data collection, energy monitoring, supply chain coordination, ECMS workflow engine, reporting, and carbon footprint estimator that integrate and coordinate four types of information flows (transactional, contextual, energy, and product environmental), and formulate design principles. Our evaluation indicates that the ECMS design theory, if instantiated, supports energy and carbon measurement and environmentally aware decision-making and practice in supply chains. We also highlight how considering energy information flows in combination with material features that afford environmentally aware decision-making and practice are key to qualifying information systems as green.},

@article{ZhangBockstedtSongEtAl2025,
 abstract = {Information goods often adopt a subscription-based business model, where customers pay a fixed fee to enter into a purchase agreement. The up-front payment of the subscription fee creates a sunk cost for members, which may influence their future consumption behavior. Although price adjustment is a common strategy employed by subscription providers, it remains unclear how changes in the fixed fee—as a sunk cost—affect the consumption of information goods. For this paper, we first leveraged a quasi-natural experiment in a movie subscription service and employed a difference-in-differences model to estimate the impact of fixed fee adjustments on overall consumption. Then we used a randomized experiment to unveil the underlying mechanism of sunk cost fallacy. Our findings reveal that the average treatment effect on information goods consumption is both significant and economically meaningful. Specifically, the box office revenues of an average movie increased by 12%~35% in the six months following a sudden downward price adjustment, likely because a lower fixed subscription fee appeals to highly price-conscious consumers, who are more susceptible to the sunk cost fallacy. We also uncovered insightful heterogeneous effects, demonstrating that niche information goods, especially those driven by narrow appeal and high quality, benefit the most from such a downward price adjustment of a subscription service. Our results are robust to alternative control groups, placebo tests, and different data analysis granularity. Our research enhances the understanding of the sunk cost fallacy within the context of subscription-based information goods.},

@article{ZhangXu2025,
 abstract = {IP address revelation policies are a novel IT intervention designed to regulate user behaviors through de-anonymity and, in China, are implemented to curb misinformation. However, these policies may inadvertently encourage online attacks due to revealed geographic information. There is limited theoretical and empirical understanding of how these interventions influence user behaviors. Drawing on social identity theory, we introduce the scenario of “multiple identities” and analyze how individuals attack others—ostensibly because of the revealed geographic identity but fundamentally due to another salient and substantive identity of actual interest. We analyzed identities and attacks using data from Hupu.com, a Reddit-type platform. We observed an increase in location-based name-calling—where users attack others based on revealed geographic information—following Hupu’s implementation of the IP address revelation policy. Name-calling occurred specifically as political attacks and operated through a proxy model—instead of a choice model—of multiple identities, where the geographic identity was correlated with a more salient political identity, reflecting region-specific political stereotypes. Users leveraged this model to launch attacks for practical reasons, such as avoiding censorship. Relatedly, the policy led to a shift in content and a reduction in users’ geographic representation, as increased hostility discouraged in-depth contributions and deterred participation from users in certain regions. These findings suggest digital interventions revealing one identity (e.g., geographic) may unintentionally affect behaviors associated with another identity (e.g., political), emphasizing the need for careful design of interventions to enhance digital responsibility.},

 abstract = {Live streaming platforms such as Twitch and Periscope have become some of the most popular synchronous social networking services. To attract viewers, streamers are motivated to broadcast exciting video content while actively interacting with viewers. The emerging stream of research on the live streaming community has examined streamers’ motivations and how the viewers react to streamers. However, few studies have focused on understanding the characteristics of popular streamers. Popular streamers create tremendous business value for social media influencer investors, as they have high potential to create persuasive advertisements and endorsements for firms by promoting their products and services. We aim at examining the key characteristics associated with streamers’ viewer base, namely their personality, professionalism, and streaming affordance. Based on text mining and analyses of video content, our results show: (1) certain personality traits (such as openness) are negatively associated with both cumulative and current popularity, (2) professional players are more likely to attract a larger viewer base, and (3) social affordance, including profile building affordance, social connectivity, and social interactivity, is positively associated with both cumulative and current popularity. Our results provide useful insights into measuring and evaluating streamers’ popularity, which can, in turn, generate actionable strategies for social media influencer investors and platform operators.},

@article{ZhengJarvenpaa2021a,
 abstract = {Advanced information technologies (ITs) are increasingly assuming tasks that have previously required human capabilities, such as learning and judgment. What drives this technology anthropomorphism (TA), or the attribution of humanlike characteristics to IT? What is it about users, IT, and their interactions that influences the extent to which people think of technology as humanlike? While TA can have positive effects, such as increasing user trust in technology, what are the negative consequences of TA? To provide a framework for addressing these questions, we advance a theory of TA that integrates the general three-factor anthropomorphism theory in social and cognitive psychology with the needs-affordances-features perspective from the information systems (IS) literature. The theory we construct helps to explain and predict which technological features and affordances are likely: (1) to satisfy users’ psychological needs, and (2) to lead to TA. More importantly, we problematize some negative consequences of TA. Technology features and affordances contributing to TA can intensify users’ anchoring with their elicited agent knowledge and psychological needs and also can weaken the adjustment process in TA under cognitive load. The intensified anchoring and weakened adjustment processes increase egocentric biases that lead to negative consequences. Finally, we propose a research agenda for TA and egocentric biases.},

@article{ZhuFengLiangEtAl2023,
 abstract = {This paper examines the underlying mechanisms through which paternalistic leadership (PL) motivates employees’ information systems policy (ISP) compliance. We propose that the three dimensions of PL—authoritarian leadership (AL), benevolent leadership (BL), and moral leadership (ML)—influence employees’ ISP compliance by affecting their perceptions of two information security control mechanisms: sanctions and the information security climate. Based on survey data from 760 participants, we found that the impact of AL is partially mediated by employees’ perceptions of sanctions, the impact of BL is partially mediated by employees’ perceptions of the information security climate, and the impact of ML is partially mediated by employees’ perceptions of both sanctions and the information security climate. Our research extends the existing literature by exploring the impact of specific leadership styles on employees’ perceptions of information security control mechanisms and by proposing that perceptions of information security control mechanisms play a mediating role between PL and ISP compliance. The findings suggest that in addition to choosing effective control mechanisms, it is also important for leaders to adjust their leadership style to ensure that employees perceive control mechanisms in the expected manner.},

 abstract = {To reconcile the personalization-privacy paradox, we adopt the privacy as a state view and define privacy as a state of information boundary rule-following. We further identify five types of boundaries underlying some of the important implicit rules of maintaining privacy: communication channel, platform, device, temporal, and purpose boundaries. Using an online vignette survey, we investigated how each of these boundary types affected users’ privacy perceptions when they were subjected to personalized advertisements. Using fixed- and random-effects models, we investigated how violating different boundary rules leads to changes in perceived privacy. Our results show that all five boundary types are significant predictors of perceived privacy within individuals. The communication channel, device, and business versus private purpose are significant predictors of perceived privacy across the whole sample. Temporal boundaries and platform boundaries failed to achieve statistical significance when evaluated simultaneously with the other factors across the whole sample. This means that for each individual, observing the rules of these five boundary types leads to higher perceived privacy than not observing these conditions. Taken as a whole, observing communication channel, device, and business versus private purpose boundaries also leads to higher averages of perceived privacy across the whole sample. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed based on the results},

@article{ZorinaKaranasios2021a,
 abstract = {This paper examines how innovative uses of IT artifacts and their repurposing to fulfill emerging or unsatisfied user needs (bottom-up innovation, BUI) develop in community settings. Based on a longitudinal analysis of “HomeNets,” communities that developed residential internet access in Belarus over a 20-year period, we illustrate that the development of community BUI is driven not only by the needs of the innovating members but also by the interplay between the innovating members’ community context and technology and the interplay between the BUI technology and context. We demonstrate how these dynamics trigger community BUI development that goes beyond the needs and expectations of the innovating actors and impacts community evolution and long-term survival. Based on our findings, we develop a model of community BUI development. We discuss the theoretical implications of our findings, highlighting the role of technology and context in community BUI and its processual unfolding beyond the needs and intentions of the innovating members.},
