 abstract = {Contemporary digital ecosystems produce vast amounts of data every day. The data are often no more than microscopic log entries generated by the elements of an information infrastructure or system. Although such records may represent a variety of things outside the system, their powers go beyond the capacity to carry semantic content. In this article, we harness critical realism to explain how such data come to matter in specific business operations. We analyse the production of an advertising audience from data tokens extracted from a telecommunications network. The research is based on an intensive case study of a mobile network operator that tries to turn its subscribers into an advertising audience. We identify three mechanisms that shape data-based production and three properties that characterize the underlying pool of data. The findings advance the understanding of many organizational settings that are centred on data processing.},

 abstract = {This paper addresses ways in which theorizing gender may be important in forming an understanding of the topic of emancipation, which is central to the new critical information systems (IS) based on the thinking of Habermas. After briefly discussing some problems with current research on gender and IS the paper argues that appropriate feminist theory may be useful in augmenting our understanding of foundational issues such as emancipation. The development of feminist philosophy and epistemology is briefly introduced. Habermas’ ‘ideal speech situation’ is problematized in relation to feminist writing on male and female communication juxtaposed with recent research in computer-mediated communications. The paper continues by exploring the concept of emancipation through feminist epistemology and it closes with a preliminary consideration of how these concerns may be applied to critical IS.},

@article{AdamODoherty2000a,
 abstract = {The enterprise resource planning (ERP) software market has been growing at a very fast pace over the last few years and has been predicted to keep growing rapidly in the long term. This has led to an abundance of media reports on the subject of ERP and to managers wondering whether their companies should implement ERP systems. In order to separate the reality of the ERP phenomenon from the hype that surrounds it, we studied 14 ERP implementation projects in Irish organizations and focused on the key relationships between organizations which attempt to implement ERP systems and their implementing partners. We found that the ERP implementations that are going on in Ireland at the moment are different to the projects that have been reported elsewhere in two key respects. Firstly, the organizations interested in ERP software are, on average, far smaller than the case studies reported in the literature and the majority of the cases we reviewed were small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Secondly, the durations of implementation were far shorter than reported elsewhere. These results are not surprising if one considers the smaller average size of Irish organizations, but they indicate that the ERP movement is truly ready for an extension towards the SME market. They also indicate that the duration of the implementation of ERP software may be related to the size and complexity of the client organization and that SMEs can expect to have an easier time implementing ERPs than the current literature suggests. We also found that software implementers play a key role, not only in technical terms, but also in managerial and political terms, because they can help their clients in correcting their expectations and perceptions of ERP systems and ERP implementations.},

 abstract = {One way of generating revenue from broadband media content rests upon the assumption that multi-media content may trigger a greater intent to buy products and services impulsively. An experiment was performed in order to explore the effects of media formats on the emotions and impulse buying intentions for music compact discs (CDs). Three distinct media formats of World Wide Web pages were set up: (1) the text of the lyrics, (2) still images from the song's music video and (3) the music video itself. Each had a varying degree of visual/ verbal intensity while simultaneously playing the soundtrack in all three conditions. The results of this study indicate that displaying the text of the lyrics had a greater effect on the impulse buying intent than showing still images of the music video. In addition, different media formats caused emotional responses that can explain the participant's impulse buying intent to buy the CD. Unexpectedly, the still images and video did not necessarily generate more buying intention than combinations of the text and music. Therefore, it is recommended that electronic commerce and marketing managers explore innovative ways of integrating visual and verbal media formats for eliciting an effective consumer response.},

 abstract = {This paper examines a practical adaptation of the ETHICS methodology used in redesigning an information technology (IT) support service in an academic setting. The purpose of the project was to design appropriate organizational structures and functions and an accompanying information system (IS), to increase the effectiveness of the existing service. A participative sociotechnical approach was adopted for the entire design process which was carried out by the practitioners themselves. The staff's views were elicited during informal participatory group sessions as well as in one-to-one informal discussions. While ETHICS was the overall guiding methodology for the design, QUICKethics was used as a complementary means of analysing the requirements of the new IS. This paper describes the methodology used and the design process; it reflects on the adaptation and its match with the ETHICS methodology, exploring the claimed association with the viable systems methodology and concludes with suggestions for further research.},

 abstract = {Distributed model management systems (DMMS) represent the next frontier in the organizational usage of DSS technology. Due to the growing popularity of distributed computing systems and increased level of modelling activity in most organizations, significant benefits can be realized through the implementation of a DMMS. In several ways, the functions of a DMMS can be viewed as isomorphic to those of a distributed database system. This paper describes the objectives of a distributed model management system and discusses several important issues that must be considered before constructing the distributed model base. In addition, a layered schema architecture is suggested for designing the DMMS. The proposed architecture facilitates sharing, control, consistency and integration of models, without altering the current model representation schemes. This paper also examines the roles of different individuals responsible for managing the DMMS.},

@article{AgerfalkEriksson2006,
 abstract = {Usability is an important concept that seems to receive less attention than it deserves outside of the core Human–Computer Interaction community. The reason for this apparent lack of interest may stem from an overly instrumental orientation towards usability that does not appeal to more socially oriented researchers. Three central criteria for usability, as reflected in the contemporary literature, are the effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction with which users can achieve specified goals. These criteria are often expressed in terms of achieving goals, which, at least tacitly, seem to be restricted to goals related to an instrumental view on the use of IT. To broaden this view, the paper elaborates on how the concept of usability can be understood and used within a social action context. How social goals are related to the effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction criteria is addressed specifically. It is argued that in order truly to understand usability, we must consider both instrumental and social goals since their combination constitute a fundamental part of the social action context in which systems are used. Both instrumental and social goals affect the way systems and use-situations are designed and conceived. Interpreting usability from this broad social action perspective may be a way to make the concept more accepted throughout the wide variety of areas dealing with the design of IT systems.},

In this paper, an organizational issue of resolving conflict of interests among the stakeholders is addressed. Using the decision analytic approach, the major sources of disagreement among the stakeholders were identified, discussed and resolved. The approach was applied to a problem of implementing an information system for advanced telecommunication services. The case presented here showed how to resolve the conflicting interests proactively and demonstrated the value of the approach. The decision analytic approach presented in this paper was a viable and very useful tool in resolving the conflict of interests among the people included in the negotiation process. As a result of the successful negotiation, it was estimated to have saved $6.9 million dollars after tax for AT&T.},

Understanding the major drivers for uncertainties helped in gaining insight and thereby generated new strategies for reducing risks and taking advantage of opportunities from uncertainty.

 abstract = {More than 10 years ago, Orlikowski and Iacono (2001) examined the conceptualization of Information Technology (IT) in Information Systems Research (ISR) articles published in the 1990s. Their main conclusion was that the majority of these articles did not properly conceptualize the IT artifact. They recommended that IS researchers start to theorize about the IT artifact and employ rich conceptualizations of IT. The Orlikowski and Iacono paper provides a strong anchor point from which to analyze the evolution of the IS discipline. In order to obtain an up-to-date image of contemporary IS research, and to assess how the IS field has evolved since the 1990s, we carried out a similar analysis on a more recent and broader set of articles, that is, the full set (N = 644) of papers published between 2006 and 2009 by six top North American (ISR, MISQ, JAIS) and European (JIT, ISJ, EJIS) journals. The statistics in our results reveal no drastic advance in terms of deeper engagement with the IT artifact; more than 39% of the articles in our set are virtually mute about the artifact, and less than 16% employ an ensemble view of IT. Moreover, we note differences among the North American and European journals. Implications of the findings for two perspectives central to the IS research legitimacy debate are discussed.},

Our investigation will focus on the social context and more specifically on the role of social capital in the deterrence of opportunistic behavior. On the basis of two qualitative case studies in the financial sector, we will illustrate how the structural, cognitive and relational dimensions of social capital can reduce internal and behavioral uncertainty between the outsourcing partners, thereby facilitating the mitigation of opportunistic behavior. In our study we combine the theory of transaction costs with social capital theory and demonstrate how they can usefully complement each other to enhance our understanding of mechanisms that can deter opportunistic behavior.},

We contribute to the understanding of the current trajectory in which social media find themselves as well as to the literature on platforms and ecosystems. We point out the importance of services that develop as commercially viable and constantly updatable data bundles out of diverse and dynamic data types. Such services are essential to the making of the complementarities that are claimed to underlie ecosystem formation.},

 abstract = {It is argued that directed research programmes such as Alvey and IT86, being focused on product generation and ‘pull-through’, do not provide the much-needed environments in which new ideas can grow. In other words the 30+-year cycle of research-to-product is either ignored or not understood. This paper justifies the above statement from case histories and personal experience. It also suggests some essential remedies that are required to reinstate such GREENHOUSE research.},

@article{Aleksander2004,
 abstract = {Is artificial intelligence (AI) just something that is done in laboratories disconnected from the development of the pragmatic computing, which constitutes current information technology or does it contribute to progress in computing and information technology? It has even been suggested that advances in AI are merely a re-branding exercise for promises that are rarely kept. This paper is a personal view of the forces that have driven the development of AI in the past and what might be a serious paradigm shift in the future. The latter points to what appears to be the most abstruse corner of the subject: the modelling of the human brain and the possibility of designing systems with the brain's ability to create conscious thought. There have been accusations that AI is always ahead on promise and behind on delivery. This is an inaccurate view. In broad terms, the argument presented here suggests that as AI developed, progress was achieved by overcoming unforeseen difficulties in the pursuit of very ambitious targets, not just a re-branding of promises. This process not only advanced AI but also fed into the mainstream of computing that underpins the information technology of the present time. While the outcome of the paradigm shift towards conscious machines, which is examined at the end of this paper is still unclear, it is possible to speculate how information technology might be affected in the future.},

@article{Aleksander2017,
 abstract = {As robots are generally thought to perform human-like tasks, they depend on the successes of information technology in the area of artificial intelligence to succeed in such pursuits. But robots, through their anthropomorphic character and their weighty presence in science fiction, attract the attention of the press and the media in a way that, at times, blurs the distinction between the actual state of the art and exaggerated claims. This makes it hard to assess the true functional positioning of robots, how this is likely to move forward and whether the outcome of progress could be detrimental to human society. The aim of this paper is to review the actual level of competence that is being achieved in robotics research laboratories and a plausible impact that this is likely to have on human control over life and jobs. The key thesis here is that cognition in machines and even an artificial form of consciousness lead to operations in a set of tasks (the ‘algorithmic’ category) which is different from that available to truly cognitive and conscious human beings (the ‘life-need’ category): that is, in the paper it is argued that a major category error (Ryle in The concept of mind, University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1949) looms in predictions of serious threats to humanity. As far as a threat to jobs goes, it is argued that early attention to education and re-skilling of humans in the workplace can lead to an effective symbiosis between people and robots.},

 abstract = {This paper examines the influence of information technology (IT) on a distinct but closely related industry, the video game industry. We conceptualize the effects of IT as a process of translating three related dimensions of a technological frame - technology performance, industry practices, and use vision - from one industry to another. Through historical examples, we argue that the impact of IT on the video game industry is shaped and limited by this translation process, particularly when tensions between the two industries lead to the development of new complementary or replacement technologies, practices, or visions. Although heavily dependent on IT, the video game industry has had to ignore, postpone, or substantially modify important IT software tools, processors, storage media, graphics, and networking technologies because of these industry contradictions.},

@article{AllinghamOConnor1992a,
 abstract = {Organizations have been developing and implementing computer-based management information systems (MIS) at an increasing rate for the last 35 years. However, evidence indicates that many computer-based MIS are not as successful as they should be and many may be considered failures. There has been much research to investigate organizational factors, individual differences, user involvement and their relationship to MIS success, and in particular, one indicator of MIS success, user information satisfaction (UIS). Little attention, however, has been paid to whether UIS for any particular MIS varies for users from different organization functions and different management levels within an organization. This paper reports the results of a field study of MIS in different organizations in Australia which investigates the relationship between type of user, user involvement and user information satisfaction. The results show that MIS success (UIS) varies between users of the same MIS based on their organizational function and that user involvement in the systems development life cycle (SDLC) has a significant positive effect on UIS. The significance of the effect of user involvement varies for users based on their organizational function. Technical users are less satisfied with MIS than administrative users. The relationship between user involvement and user control of the systems development process and UIS is significantly different for administrative and technical users.},

 abstract = {It has long been argued that we need to consider much more than an observed point estimate and a p-value to understand statistical results. One of the most persistent misconceptions about p-values is that they are necessarily calculated assuming a null hypothesis of no effect is true. Instead, p-values can and should be calculated for multiple hypothesized values for the effect size. For example, a p-value function allows us to visualize results continuously by examining how the p-value varies as we move across possible effect sizes. For more focused discussions, a 95% confidence interval shows the subset of possible effect sizes that have p-values larger than 0.05 as calculated from the same data and the same background statistical assumptions. In this sense a confidence interval can be taken as showing the effect sizes that are most compatible with the data, given the assumptions, and thus may be better termed a compatibility interval. The question that should then be asked is whether any or all of the effect sizes within the interval are substantial enough to be of practical importance.},

 abstract = {In this paper we apply the social network concept of core-periphery structure to the socio-technical structure of a software development team. We propose a socio-technical pattern that can be used to locate emerging coordination problems in Open Source projects. With the help of our tool and method called TESNA, we demonstrate a method to monitor the socio-technical core-periphery movement in Open Source projects. We then study the impact of different core-periphery movements on Open Source projects. We conclude that a steady core-periphery shift towards the core is beneficial to the project, whereas shifts away from the core are clearly not good. Furthermore, oscillatory shifts towards and away from the core can be considered as an Indication of the instability of the project. Such an analysis can provide developers with a good Insight into the health of an Open Source project. Researchers can gain from the pattern theory, and from the method we use to study the core-periphery movements.},

 abstract = {Leading industrialized nations are now involved in the full implementation of national information superhighways. Their efforts will depend largely on the roles and levels of involvement of public institutions and how this is perceived and reacted to by the private sector. Through the evolution of eight scenarios of public institution involvement, this paper extrapolates the consequences that each brings about in the development of a national information superhighway. In particular, this paper examines the consequences of the development of an information superhighway for the UK within the context of each scenario and draws comparisons with developments in other countries. Contrary to popular belief, we show that there is no full solution for the shortcomings experienced in the development of the UK's information superhighway; rather, each scenario offers solutions for a subset of the shortcomings.},

 abstract = {Variation in tutoring strategies plays an important part in intelligent tutoring systems. The potential for providing an adaptive intelligent tutoring system depends on having a range of tutoring strategies to select from. In order to react effectively to the student's needs, an intelligent tutoring system has to be able to choose intelligently among the strategies and determine which strategy is best for an individual student at a particular moment. This paper describes, through the discussion pertaining to the implementation of SONATA, a music theory tutoring system, how an intelligent tutoring system can be developed to support multiple tutoring strategies during the course of interaction. SONATA has been implemented using a hypertext tool, HyperCard II. 1.},

 abstract = {With increasing cost-reduction pressures, outsourcing of information systems (IS) functions has emerged as an important option for managers in companies around the world. In this paper we present the results of our exploratory, empirical research comparing practices of domestic and global IS outsourcing in the USA, Japan and Finland. The research methodology of a mail survey with similar questionnaires was used in all three countries. The paper provides new empirical evidence comparing these countries on the types of functions being commonly outsourced, the extent to which these functions are outsourced, views of Chief Information Officers (CIOs) on the desired cost savings and the comparative ratings of the advantages and disadvantages of IS outsourcing. Also compared are the roles played by different executives in making outsourcing decisions. The implications of these results for IS managers and directions for future research are presented in the conclusions.},

 abstract = {Multiple combinations of hardware and network components can be selected to design an information technology (IT) infrastructure that satisfies organizational requirements. The professional criterion to deal with these degrees of freedom is cost minimization. However, a scientific approach has been rarely applied to cost minimization and a rigorous verification of professional design guidelines is still lacking. The methodological contribution of this paper is the representation of complex infrastructural design issues as a single cost-minimization problem. The approach to cost-minimization is empirically verified with a database of costs that has also been built as part of this research. The paper shows how an overall cost-minimization approach can provide significant cost reductions and indicates that infrastructural design rules previously identified by the professional literature can lead to sub-optimal solutions.},

 abstract = {In 2005 the Journal of Information Technology article ‘A critical analysis of decision support systems research’ analyzed 1020 decision support systems (DSS) articles from 1990 to 2003. Since 2003 business intelligence (BI) and business analytics have gained popularity in practice. In theory and research the period since 2003 has seen a change in the decision-making theory orthodoxy and the codification and acceptance of design science. To investigate the changes in the DSS field, a number of expectations were derived from previous literature analyses. These expectations were assessed using bibliometric content analysis. The article sample to 2010 now includes 1466 articles from 16 journals. The analysis of the expectations yields mixed results for the DSS field. On the negative side, there has been an overall decline in DSS publishing, the relevance of DSS research published in journals to IT professionals has declined, and the rigor of DSS research designs has not improved. On the positive side, there has been improvement in relevance to managers, grant funding of DSS research has increased, there has been a positive shift in judgment and decision-making foundations, BI publishing has increased, and group support systems publishing has reduced to a more balanced level. An important result from the analysis of the last 7 years of DSS research is the significant increase in DSS design-science research (DSR) to almost half of published articles. It is clear from the analysis that DSS is undergoing a transition from a field based on statistical hypothesis testing and conceptual studies to one where DSR is the most popular method.},

 abstract = {Prior literature has identified several outsourcing motivations, such as cost reduction and access to expertise, and deciphered the influence of these variables on outsourcing decisions. In another stream of outsourcing studies, researchers have gauged the degree of outsourcing, unearthing how companies may choose to outsource a set or processes instead of the whole business function. In this article, we draw on both of these streams of outsourcing research to study the relationship between outsourcing motivations and the degree of outsourcing within a particular business function. We probe the effect of nine motivation items on outsourcing decision through an empirical study using survey data gathered from 337 small and medium-sized enterprises. We find that cost reduction, a focus on core competence and business/process improvements are all associated with a higher degree of outsourcing, but interestingly, access to expertise is negatively associated with the degree of outsourcing. This finding suggests that companies that outsource mainly to acquire external expertise outsource only a limited number of processes within a specific business function. Our main theoretical contribution lies in uncovering the dynamic nature of outsourcing motivations, meaning that as companies outsource a larger degree of their business processes, some motivation items become more accentuated and others fade in importance.},

@article{AvisonBanks2008,
 abstract = {The offshoring of information systems (IS) work has seen phenomenal growth in the past 5 or more years. This has resulted in IS professionals, interacting with workers from vastly different cultural backgrounds, in order to deliver IS project and support services. This cultural ‘barrier’ has been highlighted in the IS literature as a key challenge for offshoring; however, the attention given to research in the field has in the main been restricted to surveys or interviews, often reliant on reductionist national culture models. Within the fields of linguistics and anthropology, the ethnographic research technique of conversation analysis (CA) has been successfully applied to cross-cultural communications. However, there have been no concerted research efforts to apply CA to IS research in general and to IS offshoring in particular. Our research aims to address that gap by analysing naturally occurring recordings of telephone conferences between offshore vendor staff in India and UK/US employees of a major pharmaceutical company. The research has identified and analysed two important phenomena observed within these communications. Firstly, evidence of asymmetries of participation across cultural divides has been documented, and analysed for underlying causes, such as different attitudes to hierarchy and a lack of shared understanding of expected responses. Secondly, differences in the rhetorical organisation of conversation by participants have also been observed and clearly documented within transcribed specimens of these conversations. These phenomena led to seven findings that are aimed to stimulate further research. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this paper demonstrates how the methodological approach of CA can be applied to IS offshoring research, producing key insights into culturally loaded conversations with clear applications for practice. We hope that this evidence of the potential of CA in IS research will inspire IS researchers to use the approach in other domains as well as in further work in offshoring situations.},

 abstract = {Many organizations develop their information systems without the use of any information systems development methodology. However, even when organizations identify the need for the use of such methodologies, it is not always obvious which to use, or whether a blended combination might be appropriate. Further, in using either stand-alone or blended information systems development methodologies in practice, a number of difficulties are encountered. This paper discusses the use of an information systems development methodology which consisted of a blend of other methodologies in a real-world situation (a large telecommunications company) where no formal methodology had been used previously. A number of difficulties arose in practice, some of which were not anticipated. Examples are given of the types of difficulty encountered, and these fell into three broad categories: those related to the deficiencies in the design techniques and tools themselves; those related to implementing the system from the design; and those related to the particular environment.},

@article{AvisonTaylor1997a,
 abstract = {Information systems development methodologies are frequently classified according to themes or features. Yet potential users are more concerned with the situations in which different approaches are appropriate. In this paper, five problem situation types are identified: (1) well-structured problem situations with a well-defined problem and clear requirements, (2) well-structured problem situations with clear objectives but uncertain user requirements, (3) unstructured problem situations with unclear objectives, (4) situations where there is a high user interaction with the system and (5) complex problem situations. Typical information systems development methodologies are placed in each of these groups. Some strengths and weaknesses of this classification are discussed. One conclusion is that most projects will fall within the category of complex problem situations, for organizations (and therefore their information systems needs) are invariably complex in terms of the human and social aspects at least as much as any technological ones. The Multiview approach is discussed in more detail because the authors claim it is suitable for such situations.},

 abstract = {This play attempts to reconstruct the social reality of key players at Metalica during the first couple of years of SAP implementation. Rather than adopting one perspective about the SAP project, we provide the views of different participants using their own words, arguments and ideas as much as possible. The play is constructed from summaries of systematic interviews which were changed only to suit scholarly objectives and a dramatic presentation. At the request of the company involved, the names and locations in this case have been disguised. Act 1 describes the company's vision concerning the implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, a crisis which emerged during the initial phase of implementation and the actions taken to remedy the shortfalls. Act 2 describes the project management, the dynamics between the implementation team members and the organizational implications of an ERP system implementation. The actual performance of the play and a subsequent discussion among the participants enable students to re-create and experience the thrills, frustrations, dilemmas and concerns originally expressed by the people who inspired this account of SAP implementation. Using theatre in an academic environment opens new avenues for critical observation, integrative sense making and experiential learning.},

 abstract = {A study aimed at a determination of the organizational principles involved in systems decentralization (SD). It is based on a survey of 14 American and British companies selected for their significant investments in and mature experience of decentralized systems. There were eight principles underlying the policy and practice of SD in these companies, and the inference is that these principles appear to work. That is, considering their commonality of use and the depth of experience in the companies concerned, these principles appear to be optimizing the potential gains achievable through SD, while minimizing the potential losses. The implication is that, if these organizational principles can be effectively implemented in other organizations, they may facilitate success in systems decentralization, as well as the evolution toward distributed systems. Viewed as a whole, the principles appear to complement each other, such that they may be viewed as a conceptual model, wherein each depends upon at least one other for its effectiveness.},

 abstract = {Twenty-three government organizations, which had or were developing Information Systems (IS) or Information Technology (IT) strategies; were interviewed in most cases the scope was the whole organization. Many internal reasons led to the development of these strategies but external factors were also often present. Management structures were similar and tended to follow CCTA guidelines. The need to ‘'sell’ strategies was widely understood and regular reviews were planned. Strategies most frequently covered an implementation period of 5 years. In most cases, business objectives drove the definition of information requirements; and business issues included the need to improve efficiency, the impact of legislative change and problems caused by the creation of executive agencies. There was a widespread move towards Open Systems and security was tending to become a departmental issue. Expenditure on IT was frequently about 5–7 % of programme expenditure. Departments were reluctant to discuss the value of intangible benefits. Steady progress was being made with the implementation of strategies being subject to various problems and constraints. Lessons learnt included the needs for clear business goals, senior management involvement, managing users’ expectations and selling strategies. Departments are moving slowly in the right direction and may be expected to match the best practice in the private sector within a few years.},

An analysis of the methods used at Penguin Books suggests that a coherent, carefully planned programme, giving priority to the needs of the end-users, can greatly improve the levels of efficiency and reduce support costs once the system goes live. This article outlines the steps taken in drawing up an integrated package of research, documentation and training, and explains how the users were encouraged to contribute to the design of the overall implementation programme. The methods described are put forward as a means of reducing the massive costs currently incurred by implementing new systems, and improving the return on this investment. By prioritizing the role of the user, this article offers a coherent solution to some of the current IT investment problems.},

Such a state of affairs has been of great concern for the information systems discipline for decades, motivating information systems researchers to focus on and extensively study ISD project failure. However, the increasing complexity and uncertainty of ISD projects and contemporary system development processes are challenging ISD project failure scholarship. In this article, we ask the questions: What are the contributions and weaknesses of the extant ISD project failure/success literature? What are potential avenues to move the ISD literature forward? To answer these questions, first, we present a literature review that assesses research contributions within the major perspectives on ISD failure (i.e. rationalist, process and narrative). While the extant research within all perspectives make significant contributions to knowledge, we find that researchers remain preoccupied with ‘project failure’ as an end state of an ISD project. They pay little attention to problematic situations arising during ISD projects before they become failed projects. Based on the review and critique of the literature, we then argue that there is a significant benefit in extending research focus from ISD project failure to ‘ISD project distress’, which we define as a harmful project condition involving dynamic and fluid constellation of critical problems that are difficult to identify, understand and resolve. While ISD project distress is an increasingly perilous and consequential phenomenon, little is known about its nature and potential responses. Drawing from the sensemaking literature, we propose a multilevel theoretical framework for understanding the nature and sources of ISD project distress that provides a foundation for exploring early detection and timely response. We demonstrate the theoretical and practical relevance of the concept of ISD project distress and propose a corresponding research agenda.},

Such a piece is direly needed, and we hope it will spark a reinvigoration of the field. However, despite its many merits and our alignment with its message, we have two comments or caveats for readers of their piece. These are—a) a need to re-emphasize the value of attending to the cumulative tradition in our pursuit of digital theorizing, and relatedly b) an unreflective reading of the paper may risk mobilizing IS scholarship towards clickbait research. We further highlight three anchors that future scholarship can consider in attending to these issues a) problematization anchor, b) implications anchor, and c) boundary-spanning anchor. With these points, we add more volume to amplify the message of G&L and offer suggestions for pursuing innovative digital theories that go beyond ephemeral theorizing.},

 abstract = {Information technology (IT) applications to support group decision processes have been of considerable interest over the years. With the emergence of virtual team arrangements and the advent of emerging information and networking technologies, an increasing amount of attention is now being aimed at understanding collaboration among group members, as they make decisions to accomplish tasks. Effective and efficient collaboration is critical from a decision quality and decision timeliness standpoint. Commonly known as collaborative information technologies (CITs), many technology solutions have the capability to enhance collaboration and facilitate group decisions in task accomplishment by enabling better communication, sharing of information, ideas, expertise, and evaluating alternatives, irrespective of time and distance barriers. Many studies have investigated such individual CIT solutions in different regional settings. However, despite the fact that no single medium can support collaboration in different types of tasks, there is a scarcity of research investigating the adoption and use of multiple CIT options across regions. This paper builds upon innovation diffusion theory and tests a research model to validate five antecedents of collective adoption and use of seven CITs in the US, Australia, and Hong Kong. Sub-sample analyses of data collected from 344 organizations in these three regions suggest that not only do adoption and use patterns of some CIT solutions vary across regions but so do the antecedents that explain their proliferation. Implications of our findings are discussed for practitioners and researchers.},

 abstract = {As banks face heightened levels of regulatory challenges, many of them, especially those in developing countries, are struggling to maintain their reputations. This paper addresses the following questions: How do commercial banks in developing countries like Lebanon respond to institutional pressures for compliance concerning anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-financing of terrorism (CFT)? How do Regulatory Technology (RegTech) solutions contribute to solving their compliance problems in this domain and why may the potential of RegTech be limited in the Lebanese context? To answer these questions, we conducted a field study among Lebanese commercial banks and their vendors. Based on thematic analysis, findings reveal the importance of technology for enhancing compliance of Lebanese banks with international regulations, especially US ones, thereby avoiding sanctions. Thus, the adoption of RegTech is mainly due to coercive pressures, whereas the choice of RegTech solutions is highly dependent on mimetic and normative forces, and happens later. Results also show that manual processes are insufficient for compliance due to the huge number of regulations and transactions. Hence, RegTech for AML/CFT is notably adopted for the efficient screening of clients and monitoring of their transactions. These solutions enhance decision-making processes for compliance teams, which become effective when the banks ensure an adequate interaction between employees and the new technologies. However, RegTech presents several additional challenges that have to be overcome for effective compliance such as finding the right vendors and ensuring data quality. Moreover, the geopolitical context in developing countries like Lebanon limits the potential of RegTech for AML/CFT.},

The study sheds light on a number of evaluation issues, including the extent to which formal procedures of evaluation exist within organizations, and the extent to which consultation with stakeholders takes place, in addition to identifying the problems inherent in evaluating IS/IT investments. The implications of the findings are discussed, where possible in the light of previous research, in addition to identifying a number of key issues where further research is needed.},

@article{BannisterRemenyi2000a,
 abstract = {Although well over 1000 journal articles, conference papers, books, technical notes and theses have been written on the subject of information technology (IT) evaluation, only a relatively small subset of this literature has been concerned with the core issues of what precisely is meant by the term ‘value’ and with the process of making (specifically) IT investment decisions. All too often, the problem and highly complex issue of value is either simplified, ignored or assumed away. Instead the focus of much of the research to date has been on evaluation methodologies and, within this literature, there are different strands of thought which can be classified as partisan, composite and meta approaches to evaluation. Research shows that a small number of partisan techniques are used by most decision makers with a minority using a single technique and a majority using a mixture of such techniques of whom a substantial minority use a formal composite approach. It is argued that, in mapping the set of evaluation methodologies on to what is termed the investment opportunity space, that there is a limit to what can be achieved by formal rational evaluation methods. This limit becomes evident when decision makers fall back on ‘gut feel’ and other non-formal/rigorous ways of making decisions. It is suggested that an understanding of these more complex processes and decision making, in IT as elsewhere, needs tools drawn from philosophy and psychology.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a structured method, based on practical experience, to derive critical success factors using a business game called ‘scenario playing’. It aims to show why this method is superior to other well-known focusing techniques or group evaluation methods. The scenario playing business game consists of submitting to managers a sequence of reports, one after the other. Each report (called a scenario) contains randomly generated outcome values for some parameters of the business (called candidate critical success factors) which the manager deemed to be most important for the business at hand. After reviewing each report i.e. scenario, the manager has to give a value judgement about it, like ‘good’, ‘bad’ or ‘indifferent’, reflecting his perception of how the business would be doing if the report was real. A statistical method is used to evaluate these answers and deduct from them which parameters are the most important for the manager who played the given session of the game. The paper contains a short outline of the statistical evaluation (learning) algorithm used by the author and the description of a software tool that contains an implementation of this technique. Finally, the experience gained by using this tool and approach to derive critical success factors on different projects is discussed.},

 abstract = {The present paper proposes psychological ownership of IT (POIT) as a construct that can provide a much needed linkage between the IT implementation and IT acceptance research streams. To assess this idea, a research model was developed where POIT was hypothesized to mediate the influence of user participation on perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU). This model was tested with questionnaire data collected from 91 physicians who were using a newly implemented clinical information system across a network of medical clinics. The results of partial least square analysis of the data indicated that POIT was a significant mediator of the influence of user participation on PU and PEOU, providing strong support for the research model.},

@article{BaruaRavindran1996a,
 abstract = {Organizational restructuring focuses on making business operations more flexible and responsive to customers. This has led to team based decision authority structures and horizontal business processes. Concurrently, the management of information has been decentralized in many organizations. Horizontal processes create information interdependencies among previously independent tasks, and call for high levels of information sharing among decision units. However, the decentralization of information management raises the possibility that units controlling specific information repositories may not readily make them available in the required form to other units, leading to poor organizational payoff. Thus it is critical to create an environment which will promote effective information flows across the organization. We suggest that mechanisms involving organizational outlook, social orientation, equitable information processing capability and communication across decision units regarding information requirements can help mitigate the information sharing problem. Using stylized game-theoretic models, we show that these organizationally oriented mechanisms have a sound economic foundation. We use these results to build a managerial basis for improving information exchange.},

With the convergence of enabling technologies, the complexity of the mobile ecosystem is increasing multifold as new actors are emerging, new relations are formed, and the traditional distribution of power is shifted. Drawing on theories of network science, complex systems, interfirm relationships, and the creative art and science of visualization, this paper identifies key players and maps the complex structure and dynamics of nearly 7000 global companies and over 18,000 relationships in the converging mobile ecosystem. Our approach enables decision makers to (i) visually explore the complexity of interfirm relations in the mobile ecosystem, (ii) discover the relation between current and emerging segments, (iii) determine the impact of convergence on ecosystem structure, (iv) understand a firm's competitive position, and (v) identify interfirm relation patterns that may influence their choice of innovation strategy or business models.},

 abstract = {In design science research, two important challenges exist to achieve greater influence in research and practice: (1) foster frequent reuse of artifacts and design theories and (2) increase knowledge accumulation in the field. In this article, we argue that replication studies could support the accumulation and development of design theories to reach a state that encourages reuse of artifacts and design theories. However, it is unclear precisely how replication relates to design science research—that is, what outcomes replication produces and how researchers should apply it within design science research. This study proposes three overarching research questions ( Does the artifact provide utility? Is the design theory complete? What design theory components fit a larger context?) and eight categories for replication studies in design science research (Test, Redesign, Justification, Adaptation, Explanation, Update, Recreation, and Meta-Replication). We offer guidance to researchers, editors, and reviewers on how to conduct replication studies in design science research and why such studies are so critical. Our goal is to provide “food for thought” on the significance of design science research replication studies and, in turn, help facilitate their widespread implementation and publication. We conclude our study by highlighting areas for further discussion and investigation, such as defining replication procedures and conceptualizing genuine replication goals within design science research.},

@article{BenlianHilkertHess2015,
 abstract = {Software platforms’ success largely depends on complementors’ willingness to repeatedly invest their time and effort to the development of platform applications that attract users and increase the platform's installed base. But how can platform providers encourage desirable behaviours by complementors (i.e., application developers) in the absence of formal roles and hierarchical control structures? Although previous studies of software-based platforms have identified openness as critical instrument at the macro (i.e., platform) level and have provided initial attempts to measure the construct, no research has been dedicated to comprehensively conceptualize and operationalize platform openness at the micro level from the perspective of application developers. To go beyond these preliminary findings and to theorize about the nature and effects of platform openness as perceived by application developers, we develop a construct called perceived platform openness (PPO). Drawing on recently advanced scale development methodologies, we conceptualize PPO as a multidimensional construct and empirically validate it with important consequent variables linked to developers’ continuous platform contributions. Empirical evidence from several rounds of qualitative and quantitative steps supports the conceptual validity of the construct and empirical relevance of the scale across different smartphone platform contexts (i.e., Apple iOS and Google Android). Researchers will benefit from the study's systematic and comprehensive conceptualization of PPO, how it is measured, and how it relates to critical application developer beliefs and attitudes. Platform managers may use our results to target the underlying facets of PPO most likely to contribute to the platform's long-term goals.},

 abstract = {This paper begins by describing a generally accepted view of the contemporary information systems development process. This process assumes the direct derivation of a prototype from data models which have themselves been derived from a functionally decomposed representation of reality. The data models are constructed using entity-relationship modelling (ERM) and data flow diagram (DFD) techniques. The paper also considers the use of Petri net representations as structured process models of reality. These representations are a means of structuring the functional analysis of observed situations for which an information system design is required. The paper then suggests a refinement to the model just described. It examines the relationship between the ERM and DFD techniques and proposes the use of logical access mapping (LAM) as a method of synthesizing the product of these two data modelling activities. An example is used to illustrate the derivation of ERM and DFD from Petri nets. Also an example of the refined process model is given. ‘Weak links’ in this model are identified and further work towards establishing a method for formally proving data models is proposed.},

@article{BergquistLjungbergSnis2001,
 abstract = {A key issue in many organizations is how to disseminate information in an effective way and, more importantly, how to make use of this information in order to create new knowledge. One way of addressing this problem is to focus on how information is socially transformed into knowledge. This includes how knowledge is handled in practice and how the knowledge produced is qualified as being something worth knowing and acting upon. Two well-established practices for doing this are the refereeing system and the peer review process. These are used in scientific communities as a means of validating and legitimating knowledge, for example by reviewing journal papers before publishing or project proposals before granting funds, etc. This paper argues that peer review is a useful concept when looking at knowledge creation and legitimization in organizations. The social meaning of peer review is to legitimize new knowledge by organizationally sanctioning it and thereby creating a platform for collective sense making. This paper uses an example from a field study in a pharmaceutical company in order to illustrate this argument. The study took place in a quality support department where the quality of health care products and processes was assessed. The organization had a need for fast and reliable updating of information that could influence how the production process of pharmaceuticals should be carried out. In order to cope with these problems the department established an ‘evaluation loop’, which shared several characteristics with the peer review process.},

 abstract = {The paper investigates how Information Systems (IS) has emerged as the product of interdisciplinary discourses. The research aim in this study is to better understand diversity in IS research, and the extent to which the diversity of discourse expanded and contracted from 1995 to 2011. Methodologically, we apply a combined citations/co-citations analysis based on the eight Association for Information Systems basket journals and the 22 subject-field classification framework provided by the Association of Business Schools. Our findings suggest that IS is in a state of continuous interaction and competition with other disciplines. General Management was reduced from a dominant position as a reference discipline in IS at the expense of a growing variety of other discourses including Business Strategy, Marketing, and Ethics and Governance, among others. Over time, IS as a field moved from the periphery to a central position during its discursive formation. This supports the notion of IS as a fluid discipline dynamically embracing a diverse range of adjacent reference disciplines, while keeping a degree of continuing interaction with them. Understanding where IS is currently at allows us to better understand and propose fruitful avenues for its development in both academia and practice.},

 abstract = {An array of UK government initiatives have been launched since 1997, collectively being known as the local government modernization agenda. This can be seen as an attempt to transform the structures and performance of local authorities in the UK. A parallel set of initiatives, the electronic government agenda, were launched in 2000 and have attempted to extend the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) within local government. This paper describes the context for and themes within both agendas, the aim being to describe the existing and likely dynamics of the relationship between innovations in ICTs within local government and the modernization of local government. The paper presents an analysis of the electronic government strategies of 22 Welsh unitary authorities and uses this analysis for highlighting a number of issues relating to the progress of the electronic local government agenda within the UK. The paper concludes with a call for longitudinal investigation in this area.},

SRA has been used, very successfully, to perform risk analysis both for security-oriented risk analysis in the City and safety-oriented risk analysis for the European Space Agency. This paper develops and describes a particular instance of the SRA methodology for IS. Excluding safety-critical applications allows certain simplifications to the methodology in the case of IS. These simplifications make structured risk analysis for information systems (SRA-IS) a practical and cost-effective basis for risk analysis and risk management in commercial organizations.},

The research findings presented here suggest that one explanation for this non-use of expert systems may be that users do not have a need to use the existing technology. We arrived at this conclusion by researching the rich picture of the task and the needs of a small number of financial analysts. In so doing, we were able to develop insights into the topic area which to our knowledge are new. Our analysis may confirm a need to re-orientate expert systems development. Thus, the selection and use of research methods which are geared to shedding light on users’ needs may be valuable to practitioners, in developing product development strategies, and to researchers, in casting new light on their topic areas.},

 abstract = {The paper reviews the ways organizations are thought to be changing as a result of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW). While claims which exaggerate the impact of technological changes should not be taken seriously, within the context of current developments in world capitalism CSCW assumes particular importance raising cultural and organizational problems at least as much as economic and technological ones. The flexibility, variety and disorder associated with ‘post-modern’ organizations (i.e. organizations characteristic of the epoch after modernism) necessitate the adoption of ‘postmodern’ approaches to understanding (i.e. approaches to the theory of knowledge developed in linguistics and philosophy) which emphasise the significance of communication, interpretation, improvization, negotiation and learning processes. The suggestion is that, for the impact of CSCW to be understood, conventional theories of organization should be replaced by theories of collective activity.},

 abstract = {Business processes, simply defined by Davenport as “structures for action”, organize the creation of value in a company. In addition to being carried out visibly, processes also have an inner dimension which remains hidden in the existing mechanistic metaphor of process management models. Aesthetic business processes draw from systems theory and Gestalt theory in order to uncover this inner dimension. The aim of this phenomenological investigation presented here is to describe the super-summative nature of business processes, in other words, to understand them holistically as a Gestalt. Mechanical Engineering students at a university of applied sciences analyzed business processes at different companies to discover patterns which they then visualized with the process participants at those companies. They used Christopher Alexander’s pattern language as a paradigm to make implicit knowledge buried in those business processes explicit. Using this technique, the structure of a pattern language for business process was developed, offering patterns for visualization as a tool for collective thinking and as a form for expressing the Gestalt of aesthetic business processes. The shared visualizations highlighted the nature of the business processes and made it possible to see, in a metaphorical way, their significant interactions.},

 abstract = {The growing power of computer-telephony integration (CTI) systems is encouraging many companies to create call centres. These deal with a growing range of business processes and, in doing so, can be used to challenge established organizational arrangements. The range of human and management issues that need to be dealt with has yet to become clear. Some insights into these are offered from a study of one call centre over 2 years, from shortly before its physical introduction to the present day. These empirical observations are set within the wider literature on organizational change and information technology (IT), particularly the processual and integrationist perspectives. The paper uses the evidence of the case to elaborate the integrationist model so that it reflects the areas of human action more fully. It concludes by outlining the implications of this perspective for managers seeking to build effective call centres or other forms of interorganizational IT system.},

However, the dynamic nature of both information systems and organizations makes a close alignment more an aspiration than a state.

In so doing they may also develop core capabilities in managing IS innovation, which enable sustained competitive advantage. The paper traces the evolution of alignment in a company that used information systems to develop the business in new strategic directions, and shows how semi-structures contributed to this.},

 abstract = {General guidelines for conducting literature reviews often do not address the question of literature searches and dealing with a potentially large number of identified sources. These issues are specifically addressed by so-called systematic literature reviews (SLRs) that propose a strict protocol for the search and appraisal of literature. Moreover, SLRs are claimed to be a ‘standardized method’ for literature reviews that is replicable, transparent, objective, unbiased and rigorous, and thus superior to other approaches for conducting literature reviews. These are significant and consequential claims that – despite increasing adoption of SLRs – remained largely unnoticed in the information systems (IS) literature. The objective of this debate is to draw attention of the IS community to SLR's claims, to question their justification and reveal potential risks of their adoption. This is achieved by first examining the origins of SLR and the prescribed SLR process and then by critically assessing their claims and implications. In this debate, we show that SLRs are applicable and useful for a very specific kind of literature review, a meta study that identifies and summarizes evidence from earlier research. We also demonstrate that the claims that SLRs provide superior quality are not justified. More importantly, we argue that SLR as a general approach to conducting literature reviews is highly questionable, concealing significant perils. The paper cautions that SLR could undermine critical engagement with literature and what it means to be scholarly in academic work.},

What is the view of ‘evidence’ in SLRs and the evidence-based practice movement and what are potential implications for ‘research informing IS practice'? How can the efficiency and effectiveness of literature reviews be improved?

 abstract = {Bureaucracies in the Weberian mould, whether of the state or corporate type, are rational-legal structures organized to deliver order, stability and predictability. Early developments in information and communication technologies (ICTs) appeared set to deliver such an outcome. Yet the new economy turns out to be more ‘distributed’ than had originally been expected. What is the nature of the challenge that this poses for bureaucracies? To address this question, the paper first presents a conceptual framework, the Information-Space or l-Space, which allows us to explore the relationship between how knowledge is structured and how it flows within and between populations of agents. The paper then examines what cultural and institutional challenges the new ICTs pose for both state and corporate bureaucracies, confronted as they are with the complexities of an increasingly distributed social order.},

 abstract = {This paper reports on the findings of an empirically based case study of the use of function points analysis (FPA) by the information systems division of a large financial services company. The software engineering productivity figures measured by FPA in this company varied widely across the departments of the division and projects. Investigation of the reasons for the variations showed that, in addition to factors such as the technology platform and application characteristics, organizational and human factors affect the accuracy and reliability of productivity figures. Elucidating the lessons from this case, this paper suggests that three factors – knowledge of the FPA, calibration of the function point productivity indicator and rigour of the measurement process – are critical to the successful implementation of an FPA programme. These findings and the issues identified in the paper will be of interest to academics in the area of software productivity measurement and companies considering FPA as a productivity metric.},

@article{Bonner2013,
 abstract = {The call for historical research In IS, mirrored In other fields of business studies, Is an explicit recognition of the predominance of presentism in business research; the use of the past only to justify and validate current beliefs or inserting modern beliefs onto the past, rather than using the past to understand and reveal current assumptions and biases. There is freedom in severing time and centering ourselves and our artifacts (computer technology), looking to improve the future unburdened by the past. Yet, if that assumption is wrong, and the present is instead fluid and unstable because the past embedded in the present is tension filled and unresolved, this raises fundamental challenges to the work that we do, the value of that work to others, and is cause for reflection on our impact as educators. This paper demonstrates the merits of using Actor-Network Theory as a methodology for historical IS research, through its use in a Canadian case study. The study was prompted by the apparent resolution of a privacy controversy, involving personal motor vehicle registration information in the province of Alberta, through an appeal to something called ‘historical purposes and practices.’ Strangely, the purposes and practices were never identified. This begged the question, ‘what was the substance of this argument and how come it was successful?’ Tracing actual ‘purposes and practices,’ from the early 1900s to the present, reveals how historical, contextual understanding offers not only insights into, but can alter our very understanding of, the present.},

 abstract = {Based on a series of structured interviews with several senior management figures, this paper explores two different approaches to competitiveness within the literature, namely the technology-driven approach and the competency-driven approach, and asks whether they can be reconciled with the real world experiences of corporate managers. The technology driven approach is based on the belief that information technology (IT) offers a powerful source of competitive advantage. Popularized by, and based on the work of, Michael Porter there is a corresponding emphasis on planning and the use of ‘generic’ strategies. The competency driven approach, on the other hand, holds that each company possesses unique sources of advantage, which it must exploit to derive maximum benefits. The focus is on flexibility, while no ‘recipes’ for success are offered. Given that these two approaches appear to be diametrically opposed, 16 senior management figures from leading edge companies were interviewed to determine which, if either, of the two views was more in tune with reality. This paper details the findings.},

@article{Borman1994a,
 abstract = {This paper seeks to investigate the potential for interorganizational networks (IONs) to facilitate a challenge to the current hegemony of integrated production. From a transaction cost perspective the choice between market and hierarchical modes of production depends upon their relative coordination costs. The argument developed here is that uncertainty has precipitated market failure and the consequent rise of large, integrated concerns. IONs, however, by facilitating the cost-effective diffusion of information can reduce the coordination costs associated with the market place and permit the deintegration of production. The greatest benefits are held to be realized where the development of common knowledge between connected trading partners permits the ‘free flow’ of information. Supporting empirical work consists of a comprehensive survey of the uptake of IONs in the Scottish electronics industry and the development of case studies in a variety of companies highlighting the specific processes at work. Tentative conclusions indicate that while IONs do represent an opportunity for the emergence of new, more collaborative modes of production such an outcome is by no means assured. ‘changes consist primarily in a relative decline in the importance of Fordist mass production and an enormous expansion of manufacturing activities based on less rigid and more highly adaptable (i.e., flexible) technological and institutional structures’ (Scott, 1988, p. 171).},

 abstract = {Information Technology enabled Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) is a growing phenomenon, yet little research has been conducted to understand the factors that determine its appropriateness for organisations and what capabilities they should seek in potential suppliers. A multi-perspective approach to the BPO decision, encompassing the transaction, the organisation and its context, is proposed and a set of supplier capabilities to deliver upon it is outlined. A case study of outsourced call centres in Australia, based upon interviews with three suppliers and three clients, suggests such a multi-perspective approach is useful but that the interaction between the factors shaping the BPO decision is more complex than envisaged. The case also suggests that a common set of capabilities is sought from suppliers – though it is narrower than first proposed.},

 abstract = {Intense pressure to control costs and improve patient care quality is driving hospitals to increasingly look to information technology (IT) for solutions. As IT investment and IT capability have grown in hospitals, the need to manage IT resources aggressively has also increased. The rise in complexity and sophistication of the IT capability in hospitals has also increased the importance of IT governance in these organizations. Yet, there is limited empirical data about the antecedents and consequences of IT governance. We draw upon extant literature related to power and politics and capability management to propose, operationalize, and empirically examine a nomological model that explains and predicts IT governance and its ensuing impact on risk management and IT contribution to hospital performance. We empirically tests our hypotheses based on survey data gathered from 164 CIOs of US hospitals. The results have implications for hospitals’ readiness and predisposition for IT governance, as their structural and relational mechanisms can affect IT governance and, indirectly, IT value creation. A contribution of this study is that it is one of the first to empirically examine antecedents to IT governance and its impact on IT performance in a high-velocity environment that is riddled with technological turbulence.},

The well documented problems which persist in the software engineering industry are, we believe, largely attributable to the inappropriate education of software engineers. An alternative approach to the education of undergraduate software engineers is outlined; one which is based upon the concept of ‘software as a product’.},

@article{BrendelLembckeMuntermannEtAl2021,
 abstract = {In design science research, two important challenges exist to achieve greater influence in research and practice: (1) foster frequent reuse of artifacts and design theories and (2) increase knowledge accumulation in the field. In this article, we argue that replication studies could support the accumulation and development of design theories to reach a state that encourages reuse of artifacts and design theories. However, it is unclear precisely how replication relates to design science research—that is, what outcomes replication produces and how researchers should apply it within design science research. This study proposes three overarching research questions ( Does the artifact provide utility? Is the design theory complete? What design theory components fit a larger context?) and eight categories for replication studies in design science research (Test, Redesign, Justification, Adaptation, Explanation, Update, Recreation, and Meta-Replication). We offer guidance to researchers, editors, and reviewers on how to conduct replication studies in design science research and why such studies are so critical. Our goal is to provide “food for thought” on the significance of design science research replication studies and, in turn, help facilitate their widespread implementation and publication. We conclude our study by highlighting areas for further discussion and investigation, such as defining replication procedures and conceptualizing genuine replication goals within design science research.},

 abstract = {Early in 2004, the British Government announced the award of eight enormous IT contracts with a combined value of more than £6 billion. The companies selected would introduce new IT systems and processes to Europe's largest public sector organisation, the National Health Service (NHS) in England. The contracts were due to run for 7 years, until December 2010. At the end of June this year, the contracts will be exactly halfway through. But all is not well with the National Programme for IT (NPfIT), and both the programme and the agency NHS Connecting for Health (NHS CfH) set up to deliver the programme, have received considerable, and sustained criticism from many sources since their inception. Is this criticism justified or are some critics simply jumping onto a bandwagon? This paper attempts to provide an unbiased (if such a thing is possible) commentary on the programme so far.},

 abstract = {This paper reports an exploratory case study that used boundary theory to investigate the impact of organisational virtualisation on work units. Specifically, the research analysed the transition in a public sector organisation from permanent, co-located teams to temporary virtual teams and its impact on team boundary properties and activities. The study contributes to existing knowledge of virtual teams and virtualisation processes in several ways. The findings suggest that, contrary to existing thinking, rather than removing organisational and institutional boundaries, virtualisation increases the number and complexity of such boundaries at the work unit level. The findings also indicate that the chronic lack of knowledge sharing on virtual teams is, in addition to difficulties of establishing interpersonal trust, due to a lack of trust in the technology as an appropriate medium for sensitive knowledge sharing. The implications of the study for practice are that efficiency gains from organisational virtualisation can easily be offset by the need to invest additional resources and team members’ time into cultivating a greater number of transient relationships at a distance. Organisations also need to invest in opportunities for face-to-face interaction where sensitive knowledge sharing is a critical resource for a virtual team.},

 abstract = {The notion of the agile workforce has been discussed as central to creating the agile organization, which achieves superior environmental responsiveness in contexts of turbulence and change. Previous agility research has focused overly on the organization, paying scant attention to the workforce. This paper addresses a significant gap in agility research by reporting on the first empirical study to examine how the pressures of organizational agility impact upon the workforce. Survey evidence from 515 UK organizations is used for eliciting an initial indicator of workforce agility. The data suggest that agile workforces acquire the five capabilities of intelligence, competencies, collaboration, culture and information systems (IS). From an information technology (IT) perspective the determinants of workforce agility are flexible infrastructure platforms that support the rapid introduction of new IS and the enhancement of IT competencies across the entire workforce. The survey also revealed that information and communications technology applications increase workforce agility most when used for collaborative working.},

@article{BreuPeppard2003,
 abstract = {Information systems research has become methodologically pluralistic, not least in the hope of achieving greater relevance of scholarly output to practice. Although interventionist approaches have considerable potential for bridging the theory–practice gap, they are dismissed as unscientific because of the purported absence of a philosophical foundation that would justify the interactive research process and the co-productive relationships between researchers and practitioners that are so defining of this type of inquiry. The intention in this paper is to demonstrate that philosophical foundations for interventionist research strategies do exist. This task is pursued by the introduction of the participatory worldview, as articulated in the fields of sociology, philosophy and organization studies. The paper shows its distinctness to other, non-positivist paradigms, describes the participatory research process, presents participatory inquiry methods and extrapolates the distinctness of the knowledge they produce. The application of its paradigmatic principles is illustrated through an empirical example of a participatory research programme and the challenges that this approach presents for research practice are indicated. … most of our knowledge, and all our primary knowledge, arises as an aspect of activities that have practical, not theoretical objectives; and it is this knowledge, itself an aspect of action, to which all reflective theory must refer.

In this paper we hope we show that it is both possible and desirable to place formal notations in the context of systems analysis and design. By adopting an essentially pragmatic approach we feel that we have, to some extent, bridged the gap between the world of theoretical mathematics and the practical task of building information systems.},

 abstract = {The information technology (IT) group at a large Canadian financial institution has recently implemented a new operating framework that significantly changed the role of IT within the organization. The traditional, technology-centric, independent entity has been retailored into an integrated, customer-focused business unit. Consistent with their new vision, the IT group has shifted its focus towards IT–business integration, increased IT employee satisfaction and decreased turnaround in system development. Amongst the successes of the implementation to date is one perspective that has attracted the attention of IT executives. Customers who observed the transition of the IT group have raised concern about Riverbank Financial's ability to maintain leadership in technological expertise. IT executives must now consider the possibility that the new operating framework has taken too much focus away from technology and identify possible changes.},

@article{Brooke1995a,
 abstract = {Previous research into the profiles of analysts and programmers has tended to present their attributes as virtually mutually exclusive and, in particular, has established a stereotype which favours the analyst for development as a manager. This view, historically reified through the division of labour between analysts and programmers and reinforced by the dual-track career paths of many organizations, intensifies the problems which technical staff experience when attempting to develop their potential. Using information from a case study conducted during 1989–1990 this paper proposes that the research profiles have become legitimized and reproduced at organizational level despite evidence of their inappropriateness. The relationship between management practice and documented theory has conspired to produce a self-fulfilling prophecy. However, the methodological basis of previous research is questionable and by recognizing these short-comings (compounded over a period of over 20 years) it becomes possible to critically re-evaluate beliefs about analysts and programmers. The paper argues for a more positive view of programmers and a more appropriate career structure for technical staff.},

@article{Brooke2000a,
 abstract = {This paper presents a new framework for the evaluation of organizational choice primarily within the context of process redesign issues and the information technology support of those ideas. Through a process of scenario generation, the framework is designed to identify and evaluate choices in work organization and to make more explicit the implications that such choices might have for people and work roles. A central aim is to encourage the participation of different organizational stakeholders in the evaluation process. Process redesign has hitherto tended to be explored predominantly through software engineering and functionally driven approaches. The framework presented here offers a counterbalance to those works by offering an organizational perspective. It is based on a broad, scenario-generating technique which is firmly rooted in the organizational vision of a broad range of interest groups. Some work has already been undertaken in this field. Previous research has demonstrated the value of taking a broader organizational approach to workplace technology redesign and shown that the involvement of a wide range of stakeholders during evaluation can result in some very creative, practical and productive solutions. Nevertheless, this paper identifies some potential weaknesses in that previous body of research and proposes a new approach. The author draws upon earlier work in order to develop a framework which will provide more guidance to stakeholders during the scenario-generating process and which will make even more explicit the values and assumptions underlying alternative choices. The framework enables an evaluation of those technological choices at a fairly deep level, whilst remaining relatively simple to apply. The new approach presented in this paper is currently being adopted by an EPSRC-funded research team exploring issues of the relationship between business processes and legacy systems (for details of the project, please see web site: www.dur.ac.uk/CSM/SABA ). Future work will concentrate on producing further, industry-based case studies of its application and assessing its value when applied alongside traditional and technically focused software engineering methods of technological evaluation and development.},

It begins by addressing the question ‘what is critical research?’ showing how the definition has changed and broadened over time. Two key themes emerge from this discussion: our understanding of emancipation and the nature of unequal power relations in the workplace. The paper then goes on to identify a recent emerging tendency towards the use of Habermas in the specific area of critical IS inquiry. It considers some of the reasons for this apparent trend and warns against becoming locked into a particular discourse. The paper concludes with some thoughts on how we can continue to broaden our frameworks of thinking, illustrating this with reference to the work of Foucault.},

 abstract = {This article complements a paper in an earlier special issue of this volume of the Journal of Information Technology which was entitled ‘What Does it Mean to be “Critical” in IS Research?’ That paper conducted a preliminary review of the state of critical thinking in the fields of information systems (IS) and organization. In addressing the question ‘what is critical research?’ it showed how its definition has changed and broadened over time. This paper follows on by opening up some key questions relating to why researchers in IS should view critical research as having a valuable contribution to make. It begins by considering the apparently wide range of researchers for whom critical research has become an activity. Noting earlier calls for more empirical research, the paper looks at some examples of specific empirical applications. This leads us to consider how critical research impacts upon actual IS praxis, in particular the role of the IS professional, systems development and changes in the nature of organizational life itself. This is not intended to be a comprehensive review of the literature. Rather by drawing upon a sample of material covering a range of perspectives it aims to give an impression of the many developments in critical studies on organization and IS and to consider their implications for future direction.},

Second, it does not examine the key interactions among different kinds of tensions. Drawing on qualitative data from a distributed finance organization and applying concepts from paradox theory, we show how globally distributed units negotiate knowledge, power, and identity tensions in collaborative work. The findings illuminate how a sequential enactment of both formal and informal solutions can better address tensions and generate collaborative opportunities in globally distributed work. Building on the findings, we develop a phasal model of tension evolution and management in globally distributed work which explains how tensions evolve from a phase of suppression through to a phase of attenuation. We demonstrate the interactions of knowledge–power–identity tensions against a background of defensive, interactive, and collaborative behaviors, and suggest several practical implications for globally distributed work practice.},

Building on the findings, we develop a phasal model of tension evolution and management in globally distributed work which explains how tensions evolve from a phase of suppression through to a phase of attenuation. We demonstrate the interactions of knowledge–power–identity tensions against a background of defensive, interactive, and collaborative behaviors, and suggest several practical implications for globally distributed work practice.},

 abstract = {Tensions are a major source of communication problems, coordination issues, and conflict in globally distributed work. In this article, we argue that extant literature falls short of addressing tensions in globally distributed work at two levels. First, it fails to fully account for the intrinsic and entrenched nature of tensions in globally distributed work, suggesting instead that they can be resolved or made to disappear. Second, it does not examine the key interactions among different kinds of tensions. Drawing on qualitative data from a distributed finance organization and applying concepts from paradox theory, we show how globally distributed units negotiate knowledge, power, and identity tensions in collaborative work. The findings illuminate how a sequential enactment of both formal and informal solutions can better address tensions and generate collaborative opportunities in globally distributed work.

 abstract = {This article examines the value-added services (VAS) market. The production of these services requires the cooperation of assets and competences owned by different categories of firms. The first part of the paper points out the nature of the services and identifies a number of firms which are involved in the VAS production. The second part of the paper is based on a statistical analysis of an original sample. Three classes of services are discriminated: enhanced communication services, dedicated services, and information services. Then, we focus our attention on the dedicated services. A detailed analysis of this category enables us to identify three sub-groups of services: specialized communication services, community services and on line transaction services. Moreover the production of these dedicated services is driven by users. It is concluded that users have gained control over a wide segment of the VAS market because they own some specific competences and knowledge.},

@article{Brown1988a,
 abstract = {In the last few years the rapidly expanding application of computer technology has brought the problems of software production increasingly to the fore, and it is widely accepted that current software development techniques are unable to produce high quality software at the rate required to keep pace with this. To try to improve this imbalance, the field of software engineering has been advanced as a possible solution, attempting to apply the formal methods of an engineering discipline to software design and implementation. One of the most promising areas to be developed in this field is that of integrated project support environments (IPSEs), which attempt to spread the focus of attention during software development from the coding stage to embrace the whole development cycle, from initial requirements specification through to operational maintenance. These environments hope to improve production efficiency and quality by providing a complete set of support tools to help with each stage of software development, and to supply the necessary tool integration to ensure a smooth transition of use between these tools. This paper provides an introduction to IPSEs through analysing the motivation for providing integrated support for the production of software, and describing something of the evolution of environments for software development. This provides the context for describing current and future research trends in this area.},

 abstract = {Digital transformation fundamentally changes the way individuals conduct work in organisations. In accordance with this statement, prevalent literature understands digital workplace transformation as a second-order effect of implementing new information technology to increase organisational effectiveness or reach other strategic goals. This paper, in contrast, provides empirical evidence from two remote-first organisations that undergo a proactive rather than reactive digital workplace transformation. The analysis of these cases suggests that new ways of working can be the consequence of an identity change that is a precondition for introducing new information technology rather than its outcome. The resulting process model contributes a competing argument to the existing debate in digital transformation literature. Instead of issuing digital workplace transformation as a deliverable of technological progress and strategic goals, this paper supports a notion of digital workplace transformation that serves a desired identity based on work preferences.},

 abstract = {Prologue and preamble The views of Collingwood can be summarized as follows. The philosophy of history is concerned neither with ‘the past by itself’ nor with ‘the historian's thought about it by itself’, but with ‘the two things in their mutual relations’. (This dictum reflects the two current meanings of the word ‘history’ – the inquiry conducted by the historian and the series of past events into which he inquires.) Carr (1961: 1l)},

 abstract = {This paper explains the development of a skills-focused approach that can assist organisations to better anticipate hurdles to successful information systems (IS) adoption. This approach is utilised in an interpretive field study in an Australian information technology company. From a perspective that views IS as tools, the approach is used to analyse the management control skills required to use a specific management IS. A skills match between the set of management control skills assumed by the toolmaker and the skills possessed by the tool user shows why a group of users with a high degree of match adopted the tool, while another one with a low degree of match did not do so. The study thus demonstrates that the skills-focused approach is a valid and effective way of determining the appropriateness of an IS.},

 abstract = {Compatibility has been recognised as an important element in the adoption of IT innovations in organisations but as a concept it has been generally limited to technical or functional factors. Compatibility is also significant, however, with regard to value compatibility between the organisation, and the adopted IT innovation. We propose a framework to determine value compatibility analysing the organisation's and information system's structure, practices and culture, and explore the value compatibility of an organisation with its adopted self-service computer-based information system. A case study was conducted to determine the congruence of an organisation's value and IT value compatibility. This study found that there was a high correspondence in the organisational structure and practice dimensions; however, there were organisational culture disparities. The cultural disparities reflected the self-service acceptance and training issues experienced by the case organisation. These findings add insight into the problems experienced with value compatibility and the adoption of the information systems, and show the potential use of the proposed framework in the detection of such problems.},

 abstract = {This article presents findings of an investigation into the relationship between organizational configurations and alternative patterns of information systems (IS) development. The study focuses on the IS strategic process. A theoretical framework is developed to examine the relationships between organizational and IS strategy formulation processes. The framework was evaluated in 56 organizations. Results of the analysis support the theory that different stages of growth in the use and development of IS require different approaches to strategy, and that different approaches to strategy are favoured by different organizational configurations. Evaluation of the relationship between organizational change and IS developments reveals a pattern of strategic alignment reflecting the interdependencies between the organizational configuration and the stage of IS growth. It would appear that transitions through this alignment model are characterized by periods of dynamic change which can be predicted at certain stages of growth. The model may prove useful both to assist in the management of organizational change and to identify appropriate IS strategy formulation approaches.},

@article{Burn1996a,
 abstract = {The securing and maintaining of alignment between business strategies and information systems (IS) strategies is frequently cited as a critical concern of IS managers. Consequently it has been ranked as an important issue for IS research agendas over the last decade. Very few empirical studies, however, have been reported with the result that there is no firm evidence to support the need for alignment, far less evidence for the way that strategies might interact. This paper reports the results of a longitudinal study which examines both IS and business strategies using an external-internal alignment model. After four years of data collection and analysis there is strong support for an alignment model which follows a lead-lag strategy. This implies that alignment is not a steady state but will reflect a dynamic model of change. In order to foster innovation in IS this change model requires to be managed through a ‘r'evolutionary cycle. This resembles a professional juggling act rather than a managed stage growth process. The alignment and change models are described and related to the management of innovation and organicity. In addition a continuing and future research agenda is identified.},

Factor research is the most commonly used framework for studying the causes of EIS failure yet there is no conclusive evidence that the factors suggested in the information systems (IS) research literature ensure system success. This paper reports on a case study of a failed EIS in a large New Zealand organization and compares this case with the success factors found in the research literature. One of the findings is that the broader issues surrounding the failure were more significant than the more narrowly focused factors suggested by the factor research approach. These broader issues include the social, cultural, political and economic context of the system as a whole. Another finding was that many of these broader contextual issues were not directly controllable by the EIS project team. This paper will have implications for all those who have to develop or are involved with the development of EIS.},

@article{ButlerMurphy2008,
 abstract = {There is a dearth of research on the capabilities of innovative small-to-medium software enterprises (SMSEs). Understanding how SMSEs build and apply business and information systems (IS) capabilities is important, as such firms account for over 90% of software enterprises operating in Europe and the US. This paper elaborates and applies dynamic capability theory to explore and help understand the web of conditions and factors that shaped and influenced business and IS capability development and application in one European SMSE. Drawing on the overarching theory of dynamic capabilities, a theoretical model is presented that posits relationships among (1) a firm's past activities; (2) its integration, learning and reconfiguration, and transformation capabilities; (3) its financial, complementary, locational, and technological asset positions; and (4) the products and services that result, and which are of value to an SMSE's customers. The paper refines and elaborates the model by describing and enumerating the business and IS capabilities, assets, and products and services of the SMSE under study. To properly assess whether this firm's products and services were of value to its customers, research was also conducted at two customer sites in Ireland and the US, in addition to the investigation at the primary research site in Dublin. The study therefore informs both practitioners’ and researchers’ understandings of this complex and under-researched phenomenon: for practitioners, it highlights the characteristics required to build innovative software solutions; for researchers, it illustrates the patterns and regularities associated with the development and application of business and IS capabilities.},

@article{Bygstad2017,
 abstract = {This paper proposes a simple terminology for understanding and dealing with two current phenomena; we suggest calling them heavyweight and lightweight IT. Heavy-weight IT denotes the well-established knowledge regime of large systems, developing ever more sophisticated solutions through advanced integration. Lightweight IT is suggested as a term for the new knowledge regime of mobile apps, sensors and bring-your-own-device, also called consumerisation and Internet-of-Things. The key aspect of lightweight IT is not only the cheaper and more available technology compared with heavyweight IT, but the fact that its deployment is frequently done by users or vendors, bypassing the IT departments. Our theoretical lens is generativity, the idea that complex phenomena arise from interactions among basic elements. In the context of IT, generativity helps to explain the creative potential of flexible digital technology for knowledgeable professionals and users. The research questions are: how is generativity different in heavyweight and lightweight IT, and what is the generative relationship between heavyweight and lightweight IT? These questions were investigated through a study of four cases in the health sector. Our findings show that (i) generativity enfolds differently in heavyweight and lightweight IT and (ii) generativity in digital infrastructures is supported by the interaction of loosely coupled heavyweight and lightweight IT. The practical design implication is that heavyweight and lightweight IT should be only loosely integrated, both in terms of technology, standardisation and organisation.},

 abstract = {Recent information systems research calls for interaction between the researcher and the informants in interpretive case study research. In line with Van de Ven's call for engaged scholarship, we Investigate how to involve the informants in case studies, not only for the collection of facts, but also in the co-construction and interpretation of the case narrative. The paper builds on a longitudinal case study, in which we explored an approach of extensive informant involvement. Using the ladder of analytical abstraction as our analytical tool, we discuss how an extended involvement of informants may enrich the Interpretive process In case study research, and increase the relevance of the findings. We discuss how and under what conditions this form of involvement may take place, and potential challenges of this approach.},

 abstract = {Crises are turning points in organizations. When crisis strikes, fast-response management depends on quickly configuring and deploying information and communications. This paper brings together research and practice in crisis response management, information technology and news media fast-response methods to derive principles for using information technology as an organizational resource. Firms increasingly recognize the need to view their information technology (IT) platform as a key business resource for just-in-time scheduling, distribution, coordination, service and logistics. If they see it as an equally key resource for just-in-time crisis response, it then creates a powerful base for crisis response management. Exxon Valdez and the Gulf War illustrate these requirements. They provide a stage model of crisis response. The model is not intended as a general description of crisis, but as a more specific modelling of organizational response capability. This stage model is illustrated by Dow Coming's recent silicon-gel implant crisis.},

@article{CarrollConboyWang2023,
 abstract = {Following the highly pervasive and effective use of agile methods at the team level, many software organisations now wish to replicate this success at the organisational level, adopting large-scale agile methods. However, an analysis of extant literature reveals (i) a lack of theoretically grounded studies of large-scale agile transformations; (ii) weak assumptions underpinning those that do exist; and (iii) an overly simplistic and often problematic over-reliance on simple adherence to agile methods. In addition, there is a lack of insights on why large-scale agile transformations fail. To explore this, we apply normalisation process theory (NPT) to examine key challenges in normalising (i.e. the process of embedding and sustaining) large-scale agile methods. We present an in-depth case study of large-scale agile transformation and demonstrate how failing to normalise a large-scale agile method can unravel an organisation’s transformation efforts. There are four key contributions from this research. First, this study shows that the standard focus on initial adoption is one of the main reasons for the widespread failure of digital transformations and in this case a large-scale agile transformation. Second, this is the first study to introduce and empirically apply NPT to information system development (ISD) as an illustrative guide for those across information systems field to follow. Third, we present key recommendations based on NPT to guide researchers and practitioners on the normalisation of large-scale transformations. Fourth, we present an agenda for future research on large-scale agile transformations.},

This study places participation in an inter-organizational context where the intended users are outside the sponsoring organization. This paper uses case evidence to investigate whether factors identified in the user participation literature as contingency factors for participation are also associated with participation in the development of inter-organizational systems. It was found that previously identified factors are not predictors of participation or non-participation in the inter-organizational context. Instead, the case evidence suggests that the underlying reason for development of such systems was associated with participation or non-participation by intended users from outside the sponsoring organization.},

 abstract = {This paper situates the social implications of information systems (IS) within the broader context of progressive rationalization in modern organizations. Specifically, it examines the roles IS play in the rationalization of organizational processes and its social implications. The paper proposes a rationality framework that synthesizes different approaches to reason and rationality and provides a conceptual model for critical analysis of social and organizational consequences of rationalization in organizations that are enabled and supported by IS. By drawing on a field study the paper interprets three IS cases in order to demonstrate how the rationality framework helps explain different IS-organization relationships in the light of increasing levels of rationality that entail both substantial benefits and considerable risks.},

 abstract = {The process of information systems (IS) design has been dominated by the demands inherent in providing a technical solution to a perceived problem or need. Engineering IS design methods applied in order to satisfy the problem situation tend to have a preoccupation with verifying specifications as being mathematically correct. Difficulties arise when the ideas underpinning verification are extended in an attempt to ‘prove’ the validity of a proposed design for an IS. A pure engineering approach does not facilitate a response to the subjective elements within social situations, which experience has shown to be essential in demonstrating the pertinence of new designs to those concerned. We suggest that, by applying interpretivist systems ideas, it is possible to support concerned individuals in reflecting upon crucial aspects of the inquiry, enabling those individuals to judge the relevance or ‘authenticity’ of the learning, according to their own values and beliefs. The elements of participants, engagement, authority, relationships and learning are suggested as being crucial. These make up the mnemonic PEArL, which is offered as an aide-mémoire for those concerned with IS design.},

Numerous books and articles on the subject of IT-oriented risk management have appeared, where a decade ago there were virtually none. In this paper, a short tutorial on the general processes and activities involved in performing IT risk management is presented. Some of the practical issues that require attention when putting IT risk management into practice are also discussed. Effectively applied, risk management is a powerful tool for making an IT project proactive. However, poorly applied, risk management can just as easily lead an IT project into ruin.},

 abstract = {This paper investigates information and communication technologies for development (ICT4D) projects from around the world. It finds that computer and Internet promotion schemes usually fail despite active support, but mobile penetration in even the poorest countries is deepening organically. It argues that mobiles have emotional appeal because talking is a universal psycho-sociological propensity while the other two are principally utilitarian technologies that have to generate returns on investment. The search for killer apps is likely to be fruitless because technological adoption is conditional upon need and absorptive capacity. The paper raises questions about the continuing support for ICT4D among proponents.},

@article{ChengDimokaPavlou2016,
 abstract = {The relative importance of context and generalizability (or particularism and universalism) has long been debated in scientific research. Recently, Davison and Martinsons raised valid concerns about the possibility of false universalism in IS research, discussed its negative consequences, and made a call for explicitly including particularism in research design and reporting. In this commentary, we generally agree with the notion that context should matter more in IS research; yet, the importance of generalizability in research should not be downplayed. Specifically, we posit that generalizability should be given higher position in the scientific process and be the ultimate goal for researchers. Still, researchers need to fully understand the research context, which, in combination and replication, can help to cautiously make generalizable knowledge claims. Therefore, we characterize the relationship between context and generalizability as that of a “King” (as an analogy of the local role of context) versus the “Emperor” (as an analogy of the global role of generalizability).},

In this context, the question of whether and how information technology (IT) can support strategic flexibility remains unresolved. This paper theorizes that firms that use IT to support core competencies will experience improved strategic flexibility, which may enhance their performance. It further theorizes that these effects are contingent on the form and nature of the firm's IT infrastructure, as well as its type of ownership - state-owned or private. Using data from a matched survey of IT and business executives in 148 Chinese manufacturing firms, we reveal positive, significant links between IT support for core competencies and strategic flexibility, and between strategic flexibility and firm performance. The findings further show that the effect of IT support for core competencies on performance is partially mediated by strategic flexibility, and that IT infrastructure positively moderates the link between IT support for core competencies and strategic flexibility. We also demonstrate that state-owned firms are less likely to apply IT applications to collect and analyse market information and thus surrender opportunities for achieving strategic flexibility and stronger firm performance.},

 abstract = {Critics have argued that the field of information systems (IS) lacks a coherent theoretical framework. This paper attempts to further the theoretical development of a critical and pervasive contemporary phenomenon, outsourcing of IS functions, by synthesizing four theoretical models (resource-based theory, resource-dependence theory, transaction cost theory and agency theory) that are useful for understanding determinants of a firm's outsourcing strategy. From these theoretical models, a contingency model of outsourcing is developed which can be used to direct empirical research.},

 abstract = {Resilience is commonly portrayed as a positive capability that allows individuals, groups, and organizations to thrive in dynamic contexts. This paper questions this oversimplified view based on a dialectical analysis of a telehealth innovation within a network of collaborating hospitals. We analyze the major contradictions that characterize the adoption of the innovation. First, we analyze contradictions between individuals and groups within each adopting organization. Second, we analyze contradictions between the adopting organizations. This multi-level analysis leads to a deeper understanding of resilience as a dialectical process. The analysis of the case shows that, although the participating individuals, groups, and organizations demonstrated apparent resilience in adopting the telehealth innovation, the innovation remained in a fragile state, where it was unclear whether it would continue to diffuse, stabilize as-is, or slowly deteriorate. Hence, while resilience facilitated swift and successful adoption, it also created tensions that endangered further diffusion and the long-term sustainability of the telehealth innovation. We suggest that understanding the future success of the innovation would be facilitated to a large extent by a dialectical analysis of the involved contradictions.},

This paper, using the Louisiana econometric model as a case study, proposes a pictorial approach to present and manage complex factors essential to information technology transfer. The approach utilizes multi-layer entity-relationship diagrams to provide a meaningful framework for the entire forecasting process, provide clarity to ensure better model maintenance when changes in social/economic structures require reformulations, and provide a procedural and data dictionary for clear documentation. The pictorial approach is both intuitive and readable, capable of serving as a task management tool, a model implementation aid, and a system maintenance resource.},

The question that remains to be determined is their identification and roles. This paper outlines how the strategies pursued by a government acting as the key stakeholder affected the diffusion of a new technology. The analysis is based on a theoretical framework derived from innovation diffusion and stakeholder theories. The empirical evidence comes from a study of broadband development in South Korea. A web of stakeholders and strategies is drawn in order to identify the major stakeholders involved and highlight their relations. The case of South Korea offers implications for other countries that are pursuing broadband diffusion strategies.},

 abstract = {The purpose of this study is to explore the use of Enterprise Social Networks (ESN), namely, Yammer and Chatter, using the lens of resistance and deployment of workarounds among individuals employed in a large, service sector organization. By doing so, we can illustrate the motivation behind individual use of ESN within a large organization, the reasons for not using it and the outcomes of their choices on the organization's performance and day-today activities. The research approach of our study involves employing a qualitative approach and adopting the interpretive research perspective. Our findings illustrate that there are several bottom-up and top-down pressures, which effectively hinder the adequate or successful use of ESN and drive user resistance and workarounds. The contributions of our study are manifold. First, since ESN are actively considered by organizations, our findings can inform policymakers on the issues that might arise beyond implementation, more so, during the actual use of the system. In other words, the results of this research can shed light on the areas where their efforts are best placed. At a theoretical level, our study enriches the extant literature associated with adoption issues, by explaining that ESN involve multi-level organizational characteristics found within a specific context of use, that of ESN.},

 abstract = {The adoption and management of electronic channels provide critical challenges for managers and researchers in the field of information systems. With the recent advent of electronic commerce, new business models have emerged to capture the value of on-line electronic channels. In electronic channels, channel functions in particular can be combined creatively to reduce costs and improve responsiveness and can be dispersed among several different players. We argue that buying processes and channel functions in electronic channels are of a key strategic nature. This paper presents an analysis of the challenges and requirements of electronic channels and illustrates these with the KLM Cargo Cyberpets case. Cyberpets refers to Pets Travel Service, KLM Cargo's recent addition to its electronic commerce portfolio which organizes and facilitates air transportation plus ancillary services for cats and dogs. The existence of ‘Channel silos’ and channel coordination problems were found to be one of the main inhibitors for channel effectiveness and success. The paper concludes with suggestions for managers as well as for researchers.},

 abstract = {Control is vital for IS projects to be delivered on time and within budget. Control theory helps us better understand and explain control in information systems operations and development. However, simplistic notions about control do not correspond to how control actually works. We believe that a social perspective that sees controls as negotiated orders, and not just things imposed by controllers on controlees, better explains control of IS projects and operations. Through an interpretive case study of client-vendor control in the IS department of a large agricultural distributor, we show that: (1) control enactment involves the controller's consideration of the social and organizational context as well as the controller's intention. (2) Control enactment involves a socially constructed meaning and unintended consequences. (3) The control enactment also involves controlee intent either because of negotiation with the controller, or indirectly by way of alternative structures. Finally, (4) the control itself influences the controller and controlee in unanticipated ways. Seeing control as the result of negotiated orders between controllers and controlees contributes to control theory by suggesting that, in practice, negotiation, shaping and re-appropriation are necessary for successful control enactment.},

 abstract = {This paper 1 establishes the importance of situatedness of experience in Information Systems (IS) studies, but also critiques the limited notion of situatedness all too frequently employed. In the original language of phenomenology as used by Heidegger, ‘Befindlichkeif means not just ‘state of mind’ but also refers to disposition, mood, affectedness and emotion. The paper reviews the controversies in the literature generated by opponents to the situatedness literature and provides two case studies to show how current IS uses of the situatedness perspectives differ from the original one. From this discussion, the paper argues that the limited IS research agendas on situated action found in Al, cognitive and social sciences need to capture the inner life of the actor, mind and heart, through the scope of a renewed, authentic, phenomenological tradition.},

 abstract = {Digital transformation (DT) research is moving to new frontiers of investigation, exploring the nexus between multi-scale and multi-level stimuli and effects. This article contributes to the literature examining how DT phenomena affect multiple and connected ecosystems among industries, governments, economies, and societies. Identifying DT outcomes in a given context includes considering the organisations’ unequal development and digital presence. Non-profit organisations (NPOs) are flagships of a unique organisational nature based on non-distributional constraints and the primacy of nonfinancial outcomes. Assuming DT as a process that could improve, transform, or change an entity’s property, this research examines which specific aspects link to DT outcomes in the context of NPOs, investigating preconditions, value-creation structures, and strategic development. The study performs a meta-synthesis by developing a taxonomy of 124 journal articles strictly discussing DT in NPOs to identify objects and characteristics describing the debate. Subsequently, it questions the validity of adopting insights resulting from other organisational forms to study and develop DT strategies for NPOs by comparing two frameworks. This study contributes to the current body of knowledge by suggesting a lens of analysis helpful in assessing the (DT) value-creation structures of NPOs, a research agenda outlining future directions, and recommendations intended to support NPOs’ policymakers and managers in undertaking DT projects.},

A representative survey of equipment and applications is followed by an examination of what is needed to hasten widespread implementation of voice input systems. Criticism of the communication between the voice input industry and the effective decision makers precedes some suggestions as to how the situation could be improved. Emphasis is placed on the importance of getting experience with existing facilities so that future developments in hardware capabilities will have a successful reception. The report is intended to be useful to IT practitioners interested in voice input applications and developments, as well as the industry.

 abstract = {The World Wide Web arrived just as connections to the Internet were broadening from academe to the public generally. The Web was designed to support user-performed publishing and access to documents in both textual and graphical forms. That capability was quickly supplemented by means to discover content. The web browser was the ‘killer app’ associated with the explosion of the Internet into the wider world during the mid- 1990s. The technology was developed in 1990 by an Englishman, supported by a Belgian, working in Switzerland, but with the locus soon migrating to Illinois and then to Massachusetts in 1994. Australians were not significant contributors to the original technology, but were among the pioneers in its application. This paper traces the story of the Web in Australia from its beginnings in 1992, up to 1995, identifying key players and what they did, set within the broader context, and reflecting the insights of the theories of innovation and innovation diffusion.},

@article{Clegg1988a,
 abstract = {This paper introduces the idea of ‘Appropriate Technology’ and applies it to some of the choices organizations make when designing, implementing and managing information technology (IT). It questions whether companies make appropriate choices about the extent of technology, the allocation of system functions between humans and machines, the design of jobs and roles for humans, the design of supporting organizational structures, and the methods used during design and implementation. If inappropriate choices are made in these areas, problems of morale, motivation and system performance can occur. The objectives of the paper are to examine whether these ideas can help to identify and explain problems in the implementation of new technology, and to argue that social scientists have so far achieved relatively little in helping organizations to make more appropriate choices in these areas. The paper makes a number of propositions about new technology from a social science perspective, introduces what is meant by Appropriate Technology, uses manufacturing as an example of an environment within which new technologies are being implemented, and describes five key decision areas for managers. As a result, a new set of propositions is made, this time from the perspective of general management and engineering. The author draws on research and development experiences with a number of companies, and on work undertaken within the ESPRIT and Alvey programmes.},

We begin by offering a brief introduction to the project. Next, we review the lessons learned from a wide range of experience with IT and business change projects and comment on why changes in the NHS are likely to be harder than in most other organizations. We then elaborate the implications of these ideas and identify potential areas for change, with particular focus on the current guiding mindset that this project is about the provision of a technical infrastructure. We argue that this is, thus far, a technology project and question whether the current strategy is the most appropriate way forward to achieve service improvements. We suggest changes in the underlying mindset, along with the leadership, ownership, metrics and labelling of the project.},

 abstract = {In this paper we review two application areas in the field of IT concerning advanced manufacturing technology and office automation. We argue that new systems in both these areas have been predominantly technology-led in their development and implementation, excluding adequate attention to their human and organizational aspects. We describe two case studies as illustrations of these points and argue that the reasons for this technology-led approach lie in a complex interacting set of social systems that work effectively to marginalize the human and organizational aspects of the new technologies. The applicability of these findings to the domain of Computer Supported Collaborative Working (CSCW) is examined. There are two main sets of lessons that can be learned: those that apply generally to the field of IT, and thereby have relevance also to the special case of CSCW; and those that are particular to the conduct and content of research and development into CSCW. These lessons are outlined in the form of sets of suggestions.},

@article{CleggWillcocks1994b,
 abstract = {This article presents the findings from a longitudinal research study on regulatory technology in the UK financial services industry. The financial crisis with serious corporate and mutual fund scandals raised the profile of compliance as governmental bodies, institutional and private investors introduced a ‘ tsunami’ of financial regulations. Adopting a multi-level analysis, this study examines how regulatory technology was used by financial firms to meet their compliance obligations, pre- and post-crisis. Empirical data collected over 12 years examine the deployment of an investment management system in eight financial firms. Interviews with public regulatory bodies, financial institutions and technology providers reveal a culture of compliance with increased transparency, surveillance and accountability. Findings show that dialectic tensions arise as the pursuit of transparency, surveillance and accountability in compliance mandates is simultaneously rationalized, facilitated and obscured by regulatory technology. Responding to these challenges, regulatory bodies continue to impose revised compliance mandates on financial firms to force them to adapt their financial technologies in an ever-changing multi-jurisdictional regulatory landscape.},

 abstract = {Levels of analysis are common frameworks for describing organizational dynamics, both in the general organizational and the information technology (IT)-organizational literature. Levels of analysis – individual, group, intergroup and organizational – are typically presented as constructs under which particular organizational dynamics can be grouped and analysed. Rarely is there any emphasis placed on how events on one level can affect the dynamics of other levels. This article introduces Rashford and Coghlan's framework of organizational levels which describes levels as systemically interrelated and interdependent and, through examples, argues that the IT–organizational literature needs to adopt a more dynamic construct of levels of analysis to account for how IT affects individuals, teams, interteam coordination and organizations concurrently.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we examine the impact of customer relationship management (CRM) on firm performance using a hierarchical construct model. Following the resource-based view of the firm, strategic CRM is conceptualized as an endogenously determined function of the organization's ability to harness and orchestrate lower-order capabilities that comprise physical assets, such as IT infrastructure, and organizational capabilities, such as human analytics (HA) and business architecture (BA). Our results reveal a positive and significant path between a superior CRM capability and firm performance. In turn, superior CRM capability is positively associated with HA and BA. However, our results suggest that the impact of IT infrastructure on superior CRM capability is indirect and fully mediated by HA and BA. We also find that CRM initiatives jointly emphasizing customer intimacy and cost reduction outperform those taking a less balanced approach. Overall, this paper helps explain why some CRM programs are more successful than others and what capabilities are required to support success.},

 abstract = {Trust is a complex phenomenon that pervades human relations. It is essential for the success of business-to-consumer electronic commerce, where many of the tools that can be used in its absence (contracts, advance payments, insurance, etc.) may not be available. However, research as to how consumer trust can be built in an online environment is limited and varies considerably in terms of the dimensions of the problem that are examined. Consequently, much of our understanding of the antecedents of trust in online shopping context remains fragmented. This study uses a previously validated measurement instrument to investigate, in an Irish context, the existence and importance of specific perceptions and factors that are thought to predict the generation of consumer trust in Internet shopping. The research results provide evidence that Irish consumers’ perception of vendor trustworthiness is the result of specific factors that it is possible for vendors to manage. A modified model that addresses the key dimensions of consumer trust in Internet shopping in Ireland is proposed.},

 abstract = {Big data and the mechanisms by which it is produced and disseminated introduce important changes in the ways information is generated and made relevant for organizations. Big data often represents miscellaneous records of the whereabouts of large and shifting online crowds. It is frequently agnostic, in the sense of being produced for generic purposes or purposes different from those sought by big data crunching. It is based on varying formats and modes of communication (e.g., texts, image and sound), raising severe problems of semiotic translation and meaning compatibility. Crucially, the usefulness of big data rests on their steady updatability, a condition that reduces the time span within which this data is useful or relevant. Jointly, these attributes challenge established rules of strategy making as these are manifested in the canons of procuring structured information of lasting value that addresses specific and long-term organizational objectives. The developments underlying big data thus seem to carry important implications for strategy making, and the data and information practices with which strategy has been associated. We conclude by placing the understanding of these changes within the wider social and institutional context of longstanding data practices and the significance they carry for management and organizations.},

The theory of disruptive innovation is introduced to investigate vendors’ perceptions about IP telephony and explore their strategies that affect the diffusion process in the residential market. The analysis is based on interview data collected from the key market players. The study's findings suggest that IP telephony is treated as a sustaining innovation that goes beyond the typical voice transmission and enables provision of advanced services such as video telephony.},

 abstract = {The last few decades has seen an ever-increasing growth in the way activities are productized and associated with a financial cost. This phenomenon, termed financialization, spans all areas including government, finance, health and manufacturing. Recent developments within finance over that past decade have radically altered the way trading occurs. This paper analyses high-frequency trading (HFT) as a necessary component of the infrastructure that makes financialization possible. Through interviews with HFT firms, a software vendor, regulators and banks, the effects of HFT on market efficiency, and its impact on costs to long-term investors are explored. This paper contributes to the literature by exploring the conflict that exists between HFT and traditional market makers in today's fragmented markets. This paper argues that society should be unconcerned with this conflict and should instead focus on the effects these participants have on the long-term investors, for whom the markets ultimately exist. In order to facilitate the best outcomes, regulation should be simple, aimed at keeping participants’ behavior stable, and the interactions among them transparent and straightforward. Financialization and HFT are inextricably linked, and society is best served by ensuring that the creative energy of these market participants is directed on providing liquidity and removing inefficiencies.},

The paper describes how these strategies were developed and why and models those responses. This paper confirms other studies which argue that certain key elements must be in place to ensure the successful implementation of information technology (IT) or electronic commerce. However, this research has highlighted the fact that there are important influential issues operating at another level within the organization studied. Politics and the power of vested interest groups within an organization and managerial misunderstanding about what electronic commerce is created unrealistic expectations of the innovation by management.},

 abstract = {This article proposes a new model for measuring the digital divide within a set of countries or geographical areas. Starting from a series of elementary indicators the methodology groups these indicators into six factors of digitalization and, subsequently, aggregates the factors in a synthetic index called the synthetic index of digitalization. The dispersion in the distribution of the synthetic indexes of digitalization constitutes the measure of the digital divide. This method is based upon a measurement approach, which is different from the ones previously developed, since it uses principal components analysis for aggregating the variables and avoids many of the problems and limits shown by existing models. In the article an application of the methodology is provided within a set of ten developed countries for 2000 and 2001. The measurement framework for the digital divide presented here reveals new policy implications for public institutions and highlights opportunities and risks for managers working in the ‘digital economy’ environment.},

@article{CostelloTuchen1998a,
 abstract = {Electronic commerce is causing fundamental changes in the insurance sector. Inherent opportunities of this innovative sales channel are driving the development of a new customer relationship paradigm, development of new products, pursuit of low cost ‘self service’ strategies, and emergence of ‘virtual brokers’. The Australian insurance sector is well positioned to take advantage of electronic commerce due to the high level of PC penetration, high Internet usage, and extensive broadband infrastructure. The perception is that the Australian insurance sector is meeting these challenges. Surprisingly, despite the emergence of electronic commerce as a ‘hot topic’ in the information technology and insurance sector literature, little empirical research has been reported. Much of the extant literature can be criticized as being too generic and superficial. It is argued that until research is focused on specific aspects of electronic commerce, we will fail to capture meaningful insights. The aim of this research project is to develop a research framework appropriate for electronic commerce, research and to apply it to a specific sector (insurance), in a specific geographical region (Australia), using a specific electronic commerce, medium (Internet), for a specific purpose (business to consumer sale of risk products). The research objective is to discover which Australian insurance companies are using electronic commerce for what. The survey found that of the 21 largest Australian insurance companies only 18 have web sites. These sites are mainly used for promotional purposes and not for directly generating sales. Only six companies offer customer-specific pricing of their products. And of these, only four companies sell any of their products over the Internet. Paradoxically, despite pressing business drivers in the insurance sector and a favourable electronic commerce environment in Australia, these findings demonstrate a significant gap between appreciation of the importance of electronic commerce and realization of commercial potential. Whilst most Australian insurance companies are well aware of the special importance of electronic commerce, many fail to take full advantage. Although further qualitative research is recommended to understand why this is so, it is clear that a significant gap remains between the technical capabilities of electronic commerce and actual practice in the Australian insurance sector.},

 abstract = {Organizations are transitioning to more flexible and adaptable forms. There is a strategic opportunity for IT that supports the facilitation of change, the building of closer relationships with customers, and the harnessing of human talent. Yet in many organizations there is a gulf of suspicion and misunderstanding between the chief executive and board, and the IT community. There is a requirement for IT professionals, and particularly IT directors, who share the vision of the ‘network organization’, and who can work at board level to bring it about. There is a need for facilitating directors in the boardroom. More IT professionals would secure board appointments if they could demonstrate the skills and qualities needed by a company director. IT directors require directorial qualities which are distinct from those demanded of IT managers. They need a broader, and more strategic awareness and perspective. This article examines the qualities that distinguish directors, and the key issues which should feature on the IT directors agenda. It draws upon three surveys and a report concerning directors and boards, and four organizational surveys.},

 abstract = {This paperpresents the findings of research into the impact of computer aided software engineering (CASE) tools. It is based on a questionnaire survey of software developers in UK organizations. CASE had a positive effect on developer productivity and the quality of applications software. It particularly improved the reliability and accuracy of applications software, though this was sometimes offset by a deterioration in software efficiency. There was little evidence of productivity being ‘traded’ for quality, since developers citing productivity gains also tended to report quality improvements. The extent to which organizations were able to realize the benefits of CASE depended on the experience, competence and training of individual developers. This has significant implications for the selection and training of personnel and the use of consultants. Methodologically, the findings also serve to underline the importance of explicitly taking account of prior development environments, when using retrospective methods to evaluate different software technologies.},

The paper goes on to describe what is meant by an evolutionary development methodology, and identifies seven essential ingredients which must be present in such a methodology if the full potential of fourth generation advances are to be realized.},

 abstract = {The theory and background of outsourcing are examined from a general perspective. It is concluded that the pressures to outsource activities can best be understood through two main sources: the work of organization theorists on the management of organizational complexity and the transaction economics approach of Williamson which argues the virtues of provision of many organizational services through market mechanisms rather than by internal departments. Within IT, the early motivation for outsourcing was the cost reduction one implied by the Williamson approach. However, a number of authors have argued that the complexity of managing IT outsourcing means that it is often preferable to try to improve the efficiency of internal suppliers. This suggests that there is a need to develop a framework that will enable a decision to be made about what to outsource and what to insource. A model is applied to the IT sourcing decision.},

The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of PI programs on ISs. The study involves case studies in four organizations that have implemented PI programs. The findings indicate that changes in ISs were not envisaged as being central to the PI programs. However, the implementation of the PI programs had a significant effect on the roles and responsibilities of those people impacted by the program. Information requirements changed as a consequence of these responsibility changes. ISs were found to make a significant contribution to meeting these new information requirements.},

The findings suggest that selective and competitive sourcing may offer the client company value-added benefits, although it is important to develop strengths in the areas of contract management and negotiation and competitive benchmarking and performance management.},

 abstract = {Institutional isomorphism has been a major intellectual contribution within institutional theory for three decades. The effects and processes of institutionalization have traditionally focused on stability and persistence of institutions, and more recently on institutional change. This study contributes to the IS field using the lens of coercive, mimetic and normative isomorphism and change within a highly institutionalized organizational field of health care. The setting is the National Health Service in the United Kingdom, where in 2002 a major government policy was launched to introduce Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to over 50 million citizens. Using episodic interviewing techniques and content analysis of government health IT policy documents, this study provides a longitudinal analysis of the introduction of government policy to modernize health care using information technology. Institutional isomorphic conditions become conflicted with attempts to impose field and organizational change. As clinicians attempt to retain their professional dominance in a climate of almost continuous restructuring of health services, political initiatives to implement EHRs are met with resistance from key stakeholders, resulting in policy changes and further delayed implementation times.},

 abstract = {How value is created for the customer from e-business is a topic of much concern in academic and practitioner circles. In the light of the dot.com downturn, numerous e-business firms ceased to exist. This paper reports the findings from an ongoing research study on the development and decline of the application service provider (ASP) industry. Having witnessed the decline of the first wave of ASPs, with many failing to convince small and medium businesses (SMBs) of the value of adopting an ASP solution, the second wave calls for a more rigorous approach that clearly identifies the key performance areas and indicators of the ASP business model. Applying the constructs of strategic positioning, product/service portfolio, and value proposition, this paper represents the findings from 215 responses to a questionnaire survey on how potential and existing ASP customers evaluate the benefits and risks of ASP. The findings suggest that, if the ASP model is to succeed, vendors will need to carefully identify customer requirements and avoid the pitfalls that beset the first wave of the ASP model, which was largely based upon a technology push strategy.},

 abstract = {This article presents the findings from a longitudinal research study on regulatory technology in the UK financial services industry. The financial crisis with serious corporate and mutual fund scandals raised the profile of compliance as governmental bodies, institutional and private investors introduced a ‘ tsunami’ of financial regulations. Adopting a multi-level analysis, this study examines how regulatory technology was used by financial firms to meet their compliance obligations, pre- and post-crisis. Empirical data collected over 12 years examine the deployment of an investment management system in eight financial firms. Interviews with public regulatory bodies, financial institutions and technology providers reveal a culture of compliance with increased transparency, surveillance and accountability. Findings show that dialectic tensions arise as the pursuit of transparency, surveillance and accountability in compliance mandates is simultaneously rationalized, facilitated and obscured by regulatory technology. Responding to these challenges, regulatory bodies continue to impose revised compliance mandates on financial firms to force them to adapt their financial technologies in an ever-changing multi-jurisdictional regulatory landscape.},

An institutional analysis of our historical and empirical data from six NHS organisations identifies growing fragmentation in the organisational field of healthcare, as past and present institutional logics both fuel and inhibit changes in the governance systems and working practices of healthcare practitioners. This is further complicated by new institutional logics that place the citizen at centre stage of the NFfIT, in a move to promote patient choice and public value.},

This study presents a field-level analysis of pan-European policy on cross-border health information technology. Using field theory and institutional theory, we situate field as a multi-level concept which extends institutional and organizational levels of analysis. Empirical data is gathered from European policymakers, health professionals and patient advocacy groups on the diffusion of supra-national health information technology across European Member States. Findings reveal four scenarios depicting field tensions, as ideological and practical imperatives of supra-national health information technology policy mis-align with Member State health systems. This study has implications for policy-makers and other stakeholders, who seek to narrow the digital divide across health fields and sub-fields.},

 abstract = {Research on virtual teams (VTs) has proliferated in the last decades. However, few clear and consistent theoretical attempts to integrate the literature on VTs in a systemic way have emerged. This paper uses the complex adaptive systems (CAS) perspective to integrate the literature on emergent states in VTs. According to this general framework, VT effectiveness depends on the interaction between three levels of dynamics: local, global and contextual. Team cognition, trust, cohesion and conflict are described as states that emerge from the interactions among the VT members and as parts of global dynamics, they impact on VT effectiveness, and in the same time they are influenced by the outcomes of the VT. The insights on this bidirectional causality as well as other benefits of using the CAS framework to improve our understanding of VTs are discussed in the paper. It also provides an overview of artificial simulation models as well as simulation results concerning the emergence of the four states described in the CAS framework and discusses several ways to improve the accuracy of the simulation models using empirical data collected in real VTs.},

 abstract = {‘It's only a web site. What could be so difficult about that?’ This quote is from the cafeteria of a start-up business funded by a North American retailer, after the disastrous ‘Black Friday’ of 2000, during which its web site experienced systemic failure. This case describes the dynamics, complexities and consequences of fast tracking an e-business start-up. This consumer electronics retailer created one of the most visited retail web sites, from concept to operation in 6 months. Market analysts were predicting a major increase in online sales while consumers were adopting the Internet at a rate faster than any previous technology. Meeting the multi-channel demands of the dynamic and competitive environment required operational balance, stability, innovative flexibility, organizational fit and the alignment of resource capabilities with technology. This case challenges the reader to comment on how a large company positioned itself and integrated the necessary competencies to compete successfully in a developing market by establishing a spin-off operation, separate from the main company.},

 abstract = {The field of data science emerged in recent years, building on advances in computational statistics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and big data. Modern organizations are immersed in data and are turning toward data science to address a variety of business problems. While numerous complex problems in science have become solvable through data science, not all scientific solutions are equally applicable to business. Many data-intensive business problems are situated in complex socio-political and behavioral contexts that still elude commonly used scientific methods. To what extent can such problems be addressed through data science? Does data science have any inherent blind spots in this regard? What types of business problems are likely to be addressed by data science in the near future, which will not, and why? We develop a conceptual framework to inform the application of data science in business. The framework draws on an extensive review of data science literature across four domains: data, method, interfaces, and cognition. We draw on Ashby’s Law of Requisite Variety as theoretical principle. We conclude that data-scientific advances across the four domains, in aggregate, could constitute requisite variety for particular types of business problems. This explains why such problems can be fully or only partially addressed, solved, or automated through data science. We distinguish between situations that can be improved due to cross-domain compensatory effects, and problems where data science, at best, only contributes merely to better understanding of complex phenomena.},

 abstract = {Both the use of Web sites and the empirical knowledge as to what constitutes effective Web site design has grown exponentially in recent years. The aim of the current article is to outline the history and key elements of Web site design in an e-commerce context - primarily in the period 2002-2012. It was in 2002 that a Special Issue of ISR was focused on ‘Measuring e-Commerce in Net-Enabled Organizations.’ Before this, work was conducted on Web site design, but much of it was anecdotal. Systematic, empirical research and modeling of Web site design to dependent variables like trust, satisfaction, and loyalty until then had not receive substantial focus - at least in the information systems domain. In addition to an overview of empirical findings, this article has a practical focus on what designers must know about Web site elements if they are to provide compelling user experiences, taking into account the site's likely users. To this end, the article elaborates components of effective Web site design, user characteristics, and the online context that impact Web usage and acceptance, and design issues as they are relevant to diverse users including those in global markets. Web site elements that result in positive business impact are articulated. This retrospective on Web site design concludes with an overview of future research directions and current developments.},

Two key factors explain the success. First of all, the electronic network limited its service to preserve carefully the distribution of power among the stakeholders. Secondly, the system roll out took advantage of the four founding airlines’ local strongholds as points of departure. The case study also addresses the possibilities of extending the network into a full-scale electronic market for Hong Kong's air cargo community.},

 abstract = {In an era where a strategic command of global resources is becoming a requisite for success, firms are struggling to successfully unify their onshore and offshore sites. The literature on global virtual teams generally frames the impediments to coordination and collaboration based on divergent nationally based cultural attributes, language barriers, and the limitations of information and communication technologies. Drawing on world-systems theory, this paper argues for a decrease in the importance afforded to national boundaries and individual sites, and a re-orientation to the social dynamics across sites regardless of nationality. By changing the unit of analysis to the organization as a world system and focusing on emergent practices, this paper provides new insights regarding globally distributed collaborative work and identifies how to manage global relations to overcome structural impediments, to develop positive social relations, and achieve collaboration.},

 abstract = {Mobile health applications and devices (“mobile health apps”) play increasingly important roles in the lives of individuals interested in self-regulating their personal health behaviors. While some appear to be simply consumer products and services, many are embedded in regulatory programs aimed at compliance with expert guidelines. In this paper, we draw on de Vaujany et al.’s framework for organizational IT-based regulation systems to consider how systems operate in open and distributed contexts in which actors have strong agency and regulation is indirect and voluntary. To do so, we consider how IT artifacts become embedded in practices, how data are implicated in regulatory feedback loops, and how individual, organizational and technological actors are mobilized and with what regulatory outcomes. We develop an instrumental case study as a vignette of five regulatory episodes (continuous glucose monitoring systems used by persons with diabetes) to examine how expert rules materialized in mobile health apps, data about bodily states, and IT features such as displays and alarms “nudge” individuals towards compliance with self-regulatory guidelines and practices. Through this analysis, we identify two related regulatory affordances of mobile health apps for predicting and surveilling personal health. We theorize how multilevel networks composed of trifecta of rules, IT artifacts, and practices develop as a regulatory lattice through which social regulation is realized.

 abstract = {The advent of electronic commerce is changing marketing practice. In particular the transformation of traditional intermediaries such as the retailer is occurring as a result of new computer-mediated relationships. This paper uses the setting of an interactive home-shopping supermarket to examine the changing role of the retailer in electronic commerce environments (ECEs). We build on our previous conceptual enquiry which proposed a conceptual model which posits that retailers in an ECE apply a trust-based approach to consumer marketing relationships. In this paper we provide additional literature and empirical evidence to support our proposition that the relationship between the retailer and their customers can be defined by the disconfirmation of two cognitive images of the on-line shopping experience, these being the expected virtual (service brand-created, cognitive image of experience) and actual real (service-process-created, cognitive image of experience) images. This paper develops existing conceptualizations through new, confirmatory, interorganizational case data and consumer-oriented, qualitative, empirical evidence from focus groups that supports our proposition.},

A new smart card operating system, object oriented in nature, is described in terms of a client/server architecture where clients (desktop computers) run front end applications and interact with information servers running in the background. Vitesse servers, designed to be portable – ranging in size from a credit card to a small computer – perform dedicated information processing with typical applications such as telecommunications, stockbroking and interactive entertainment. A design simulator is used to model the abstract design of Vitesse, allowing for prototyping of ideas and demonstration of design models.},

 abstract = {We aim to raise awareness of context by examining its role in empirical research. We apply the dichotomy of universalism and particularism, and discuss the interaction of theory and culture in order to consider the scope of validity for research findings and conclusions. We illustrate our arguments by referencing three cases, each of which has contextual inadequacies. We aim to discourage the conduct of research, and acceptance of papers, that falsely implies universalism, relies on convenient samples or ignores indigenous constructs. We offer specific prescriptions for authors, editors and reviewers to help ensure that both the research context and scope of validity are adequately communicated and understood.},

@article{DedrickCarmelKraemer2011,
 abstract = {As the offshoring of knowledge work has accelerated, theoretical models to explain the phenomenon have not kept up. Most theoretical models assume a static transactional relationship from various factors to a binary offshoring decision. Such models do not take into account the mix of sourcing choices at the level of a firm, nor do they consider dynamic changes over time. To help fill these gaps, we use five case studies on offshore migration of software work by major US companies. Data were collected from senior executives. We use these data to develop a dynamic conceptual model that incorporates three factor groupings which collectively help explain offshore sourcing outcomes: (1) economic factors; (2) the nature of the development activity; and (3) managerial capabilities and practices. Importantly, the model includes five feedback loops among sourcing decisions, sourcing mix, and these three factors. Thus, the relationships in the model are not unidirectional, nor static; rather, they are Iterative and dynamic, involving feedback loops, learning, and cumulative effects over time. In this dynamic model, the sourcing ‘mix,’ a continuously changing offshore portfolio, is a key firm-level dependent variable, closer to the economic concept of a ‘stock’ measure that represents the cumulative effect of sourcing decisions over time. This variable may be measured in different ways, for instance as the amount of work done offshore, or the number of workers employed offshore.},

A descriptional framework was used to describe systematically different types of outsourcing. A theoretical foundation for the IS outsourcing decision was derived from established organizational theories. These findings were investigated by retrospective and longitudinal in-depth case study research into 23 IS outsourcing arrangements in six organizations. The case studies were performed in the Netherlands, and comprised systematic analysis of actual short and long term effects of IS outsourcing.},

@article{DeMarcoSorrentino2007,
 abstract = {This paper aims to highlight the relevance of a cultivation approach with the goal of exploring the concrete implications it may have for public administrations (PA) involved in projects of organisational change. We suggest that adopting an approach to change that reflects the cultivation perspective is an unavoidable choice for PA, much more so than it is for the corporate world. The claim is that public-sector organisations design and implement organisational solutions that find it hard to move away from the ‘maintenance’ logic of legacy systems. Compared with the rational perspective, which is geared entirely to establishing optimal relations between means and ends, the cultivation approach enables us to make valuable advances at the interpretive level. We argue that the value of the processual and incremental perspective can be useful in creating a more realistic and less illusory reconstruction of the relationship between technological change and organisational change. In this paper, we discuss how combining policy studies with ICT social studies can help empower the cultivation logic, originating new tools for analysing and evaluating e-government results.},

@article{Deutsch1986a,
 abstract = {This paper investigates some of the currently available optical disk storage and retrieval systems, image manipulation systems and OCR systems. Future developments are presented and an attempt at outlining a longer term trend is made. The main conclusions of the paper are as follows: 1. Optical disk systems which are currently available are costly and are accompanied by excessive software and hardware capabilities which might be beyond the needs of the straightforward document storage and retrieval application. A tailor-made system to suit a specific application might be the route to follow provided read-only and multiple access operations are required and the optical system has a definite overall performance advantage over-microform. 2. In general, the document handling times of both the scanners and the printers of optical systems present a constraint on their continued rapid operation. 3. For general applications it might be advisable to wait for at least a year or two by which time erasable disk media should be available and some degree of disk standardization will have evolved. Costs however could still be a factor at that time. 4. The office-supplies industry is not expecting optical systems to have an appreciable effect on the ‘paperless office’ before 1990. 5. Image manipulation systems currently available are too generalized, slow and require excessive computer storage. Their range of performance is somewhat limited. Should such a system be required, it would be best to develop application-specific software taking advantage of computer configuration.},

This paper seeks to investigate how WFMSs are being exploited and used commercially by UK-based organizations operating in the financial services sector. In-depth interviews were conducted with 14 project managers to explore the development, application and commercial implications of this powerful yet flexible technology. The results indicate that work flow technology has the potential to facilitate significant changes in the way in which an organization conducts its business, through the automation of a wide range of document-intensive operations. Furthermore, when applied in a well-focused manner, it has the potential to realize significant increases in an organization's flexibility and productivity, as well as delivering major improvements to the quality, speed and consistency of customer service.},

 abstract = {The Metaverse has become a buzz-phrase among tech businesses. Facebook’s rebranding to Meta is symptomatic of this. Many firms and other actors are trying to shape visions of the Metaverse, leading to confusion about the term’s meaning. We use social construction of technology (SCOT) theory to disentangle the conflicting notions proposing that what the Metaverse is and will become relies on the collective sensemaking processes. We point out similarities and differences between various concepts presented in the public media and link them to individual actors’ monetary, political, or social motives. We describe the tensions that occur because of the conflicting interests. As the Metaverse is an emerging phenomenon, opportunities exist to reorient it toward humanist values rather than singular interests. However, the complexity of the social processes that shape the Metaverse requires a considerate approach rather than premature conclusions about the Metaverse’s characteristics. The analysis presents the Metaverse as a new, continually evolving sociotechnical phenomenon, and calls for research that explores it as a dynamic, moving target.},

@article{DombergerFernandezFiebig2000a,
 abstract = {The rapidly increasing use of outsourcing for IT services, both in the public and private sectors, has attracted much interest from researchers and practitioners alike. While early studies of IT outsourcing were largely qualitative in nature, more recent studies have attempted to analyse the outcomes achieved in quantitative terms. This paper is consistent with the latter, but goes further by modelling the price, performance and contract characteristics that are relevant to IT outsourcing. A two-equation recursive regression model was used to analyse 48 contracts for IT support and maintenance. The results did not reveal any quantitatively significant price-performance trade-off, but did suggest that first-term contracts (i.e. the first ever contract awarded by a client for the provision of a particular IT service) were more expensive than repeat contracts. Although competitive tendering did not result in lower prices than directly negotiated contracts, it was associated with comparatively better performance. Well-defined expectations of an organization's IT requirements were also likely to lead to improved performance when the service was outsourced.},

It is equally clear that there is great potential for using IT in marketing and CS, at both operational and strategic levels.

 abstract = {Despite the general consensus regarding the critical role of top management in the information systems (ISs) implementation process, the literature has not yet provided a clear and compelling understanding of the top management support (TMS) concept. Applying metastructuring (Orlikowski et al., 1995) as a guiding framework for understanding TMS behaviors, this paper attempts to address the gap by focusing on two key questions: (1) What supportive actions do top managers engage in during IS implementations? (2) How do these actions affect IS implementation outcomes? Analyses of in-depth case studies at two Canadian universities that had implemented a large-scale enterprise system revealed three distinct types of TMS actions: TMS - resource provision (TMSR - actions related to supplying key resources such as funds, technologies, staff, and user training programs); TMS - change management (TMSC - actions related to fostering organizational receptivity of a new IS); and TMS - vision sharing (TMSV - actions related to ensuring that lower-level managers develop a common understanding of the core objectives and ideals for the new system). Results suggest that different support behaviors exercise different influences on implementation outcomes, and that top managers need to adjust their support actions to achieve the desired outcomes. In particular, TMSR affected project completion, TMSC impacted formation of user skills and attitudes, and TMSV influenced middle manager buy-in. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.},

 abstract = {This paper argues that interpretive researchers need to consciously adopt a critical and reflective stance in relation to the role that the information technologies which they describe play in maintaining social orders and power relations in organizations. The concern of the paper is to highlight potential shortcomings in the treatment of technology in interpretive research on information systems, but also to present a specific approach to studying information technology and organization which may overcome these weaknesses. By utilizing a perspective drawn from the discursive and disciplinary work of Foucault and recent work on the sociology of technology, we can complement the thick description of interpretive research with the broader sweep of critical social theory.},

This paper charts the diffusion of digital desktop publishing (dtp) systems within the magazine publishing sector, and assesses the threats and opportunities of the new information technologies for print publishing. In particular, the paper focuses on the organizational changes accompanying the new techniques as publishers internalize page make-up, and in so doing bring into question the long term future of an independent pre-press sector. The paper highlights the obstacles in the path towards full digital publishing, and examines the factors behind the slow diffusion of dtp amongst magazine publishers. Finally, the strategic implications for decision makers are assessed, and some wider issues arising from our study for the information technology community are considered.},

 abstract = {Financialization describes a phenomenon whereby financial markets assume an increasingly dominant role within the economy. This paper seeks to dissect the role of information and communications technology (ICT) in financialization by following a cross-disciplinary approach across finance, economics and information systems. Accordingly, we develop a general framework describing the relationship between ICT and financialization. This framework allows us to investigate the recent rise of online marketplaces for credit. Consequently, ICT is not only facilitating, but fundamentally driving a disintermediation of banks through advances in computing, communication and information technology. We also provide supporting evidence from interviews with almost 40 senior experts and C-level executives. Interestingly, only rather recent innovations have enabled the popularity of marketplace lending, such as cloud computing, big data, scalable IT infrastructures and comprehensive ecosystems of programming interfaces. In contrast, we observe a slow integration of advanced analytics in the field of risk management. Based on our analysis, the paper also discusses cross-country implications for marketplace lending, financialization and regulation.},

 abstract = {Blockchain technology has enabled so-called smart contracts between different parties on a decentralized network. These self-enforceable and self-executable computerized contracts could initiate a fundamental paradigm shift in the understanding and functioning of our legal practices. Opportunities for their application are increasingly understood, and numerous tests of feasibility have been completed. However, only very few use cases have yet been implemented at scale. This article—as the first of its kind—comprehensively analyzes the underlying challenges and locates a key reason for the slow adoption in the discrepancy between legal requirements and IT capabilities. Our work combines a wide range of academic sources and interviews with 30 domain experts from IT, the legal domain and private industry. First, we establish that smart contracts still fall within the boundaries of the general legal framework. We then systematically dissect current shortcomings of smart contracts on three distinct levels, namely, (1) how smart contracts are likely to cause conflicts with existing laws, (2) how smart contracts are intrinsically limited on an individual contract level and (3) how they are impeded by their current technical design. Across those levels, we dissect 20 distinct issues concerning the current implementation of smart contracts for which we derive potential remedies. We further outline implications for policy-makers as well as IT management, and examine how information systems research can play an important role in advancing smart contracts. Finally, we show how managerial and organizational issues might represent an ongoing challenge for the widespread adoption of smart contracts.},

@article{Drummond1996a,
 abstract = {The term ‘risk management’ implies that risk is something which can be quantified, predicted and controlled. This paper seeks to demonstrate the limits of this assumption where complex projects are involved. The argument is based upon a case study of a failed &pound;80 million IT venture known as Taurus. Analysis focuses upon the relationship between politics and the assumption of risk. Acceptance of risk, it is argued, is ultimately determined by the balance of power between decision makers. Moreover, risk analysis and other techniques of management may actually compound the difficulties by fostering an illusion of control and escalation. The implications for project management are discussed.},

 abstract = {This paper analyses how Nick Leeson exploited information technology (IT) in order to trade without authority and thereby causing Barings Bank to collapse. What emerges suggests that, not only can IT systems enable malfeasance on a large scale, but that very little specialist knowledge is required in order to turn the computer into an accomplice. The most disturbing feature of the Barings Bank debacle is the contrast between the mundane act of suppressing a control mechanism and the consequences that flowed from this act. It is argued that organizational security ultimately lies in knowing the limits of one's information.},

@article{Drummond2008,
 abstract = {This paper uses a case study to illustrate and further extend the notion of ‘socially destructive systems’. Baskerville and Land define a destructive information system as either coming apart internally or threatening to take their environment apart. Building upon their insights, this paper suggests that destructive systems emerge from the very attributes that attract organisations to information systems in the first place - a phenomenon encapsulated by the so-called ‘Icarus paradox’. Icarus flew so close to the Sun that his wax wings that had enabled him to fly in the first place melted sending him plunging to his death. The case study of an insurance company shows how a system that increased claims processing productivity in the short run resulted in higher costs and lower customer satisfaction in the long run. The paradox is explained by a disconnect between ‘espoused-theory’ and ‘theory-in-use’. Issues for further research include developing techniques of impact analysis to measure recursive losses arising from ‘destructive systems’ and for gauging the level of complexity at which computer-based automation becomes counterproductive. An important recommendation for practice is that computer-based systems are efficient only to a point. For more complex tasks organisations may need to put more emphasis upon developing people.},

 abstract = {Intelligent computer-assisted instruction (ICAI) uses artificial intelligence techniques to imitate in computer form the power of human tutorial processes. Its major technical features are the use of a modularized knowledge base instead of CAI's textual scripts, and the ability to interpret the student's statements and questions expressed in natural English. These features make ICAI systems extremely flexible and allow the student much greater learner control of the interaction than is traditionally possible in CAI. Other major elements of an ICAI system are an extensive model of the student and an explicit model of the tutoring process. Our research on the development of GEO, an ICAI system which interacts with students in the area of geography, is briefly described. Finally, the nature of this new technology is discussed in terms of its potential influence on university teaching and learning, especially in terms of our conception of learning.},

@article{Duclos2016,
 abstract = {Recent years were marked by the implementation of many eHealth projects using information and communication technologies to provide health services in developing countries. While generating great expectations, these projects remain poorly documented and available data suggest high failure rates. This raises a practical question: How are such eHealth networks to be effectively designed and implemented? This paper addresses this question. Specifically, it presents an ethnographic study of the Pan-African e-Network, a project which connects many hospitals all across India and Africa, providing medical teleconsultations and distance learning services. The study investigates the low utilisation of the network, an issue undermining its potential and efficiency. Factors contributing to this situation include communication barriers, the presumed ego of doctors, poor awareness of the project, and a lack of flexibility to work with the specificities of the connected sites. Above all, these factors point towards a dichotomous approach across the project's design and implementation, and taking two distinct yet related forms: (a) an ontological divide between technical and ‘non-technical’ domains; (b) a political sorting out of what is and what is not the project, aimed at neutralising and accounting for heterogeneous processes and practices. In both cases, low utilisation reveals tensions between processes of closure and control, and the openness of a life that will not be contained. Ultimately, this paper intends to destabilise binary modes of thinking as they crystallise oppositions between design and implementation, project and context, technical and social worlds, efficacy and improvisation, mastery and unruliness, map and territory.},

The extant studies have generated rich findings on how vendors develop capabilities, but these findings have mainly been based on the condition of vendors improving their existing business.

A key challenge for vendors in moving up the value chain is the development of new capabilities while maintaining the existing ones. This challenge is consistent with achieving exploration and exploitation in organizational ambidexterity. Hence, we adopt organizational ambidexterity as our theoretical lens.

We then suggest some actual software mechanisms that could implement these policies to videoconferencing software builders.

@article{Dutton2011,
 abstract = {Research on information technology has been focused primarily on the worlds of IT and management systems for business and government to the relative neglect of research on the digital and institutional infrastructures that underpin the research enterprise itself. When digital research is studied, the emphasis has been on the diffusion of technological innovations, rather than the social and political dynamics shaping the design and role of technologies in research. However, what researchers know, and with whom they collaborate, could be transformed through the strategic use of advances designed to support research, defined here as ‘research-centred computational networks’. This article presents a framework for conceptualizing the social and technological choices shaping the next generation of research in ways that could open – democratize – key aspects of the research process that move well beyond academic publication. The framework highlights the limited scope of innovation to date, and identifies a variety of factors that maintain and enhance institutional control over the research process, at the risk of losing the creative and productive bottom-up participation by networked researchers and citizen researchers among the public at large. Conceptualizing, prioritizing and advancing study of next generation research is one of the most significant but difficult challenges facing scholars of information technology.},

This paper analyses how outcomes tied to ICT innovation are shaped by choices about whether and how to use, or not use, the technology to reconfigure access to people, services, information and technologies in ways that significantly change the communicative power of individuals, communities, organisations, nations and regions. It explains why these outcomes are not predetermined by the technology, but unfold over time through the complex interplay among many actors, in many arenas. A framework is presented to assist in addressing the issue of digital divides and other areas of research, policy and practice affected by the design and use of broadband Internet and related ICTs.},

 abstract = {The 1980s were characterized by rapid developments in information technologies, continuously rising IT expenditures in firms and high hopes about the pay-off of IT investments. In many ways., the great expectations of IT seemed to encourage organizations to manage IT as a special case, somehow above the norms of conventional policy and practice. The 1990s look different- IT expenditures are no longer rising, value for money questions are being asked about IT, changes are being made to IT organization structures and IS Directors are losing their jobs. Michael Earl argues for a more realistic approach to managing IT. He calls it “putting the business back into IT”.},

 abstract = {The design of systems which provide computer support for cooperative work (CSCW) has been dominated by models of collaborative teams in academic or design environments. Such settings are characterized by a relatively egalitarian power distribution and a division of labour established locally by the collaborating parties. This paper describes other types of collaborative work in which the r&ocirc;les of participants are characterized by pre-established divisions of labour and unequal power distribution. A case study is presented of a collaborative group allocating and scheduling service calls in an electricity company. Using the Organizational Requirements Definition for Information Technology (ORDIT) methods for responsibility analysis a number of alternative organizational structures are described which may serve this task. The alternatives are based upon different job design structures which distribute responsibilities to work r&ocirc;les by different rationales. An analysis is offered of the different CSCW systems that would be necessary to support these alternatives. The paper concludes by examining the implications of pre-established but variable organizational structures for the design of generic CSCW systems.},

It concludes that there are opportunities and offers one case study example in a Mental Health Trust.

 abstract = {Research on IT personnel has observed that the major predictors for turnover intention are job satisfaction and organizational commitment. However, less is known about how these predictors are determined and how they vary according to the different job types of IT personnel. Hence, we develop and evaluate a dispositional model of turnover intention across IT job types as the first approach in IT turnover research combining the personality traits of the five-factor model and the basic turnover model found among Western IS professionals into one research model. By the help of the model we analyze the role of personality in IT personnel turnover across four groups of IT roles: consultants, programmers, system engineers, and system administrators. The results of an empirical analysis of 813 IT personnel reveal significant differences across the four groups in terms of personality and job-related attitudes. In terms of personality traits, system engineers rank highest in openness and conscientiousness, IT consultants in extraversion, programmers in neuroticism, and system administrators in agreeableness. In 50% of all cases, personality traits are significant predictors for job-related attitudes. Additionally, they indirectly affect IT personnel turnover intention. Neuroticism, extraversion, and conscientiousness are also important indirect predictors for turnover intention, whereas openness has only a weak effect and agreeableness no measurable effect.},

 abstract = {Technology adoption research has long struggled to incorporate normative beliefs from sources in the social environment of adopters into adoption models. We study the role of social influence from different workplace referent groups, like superiors and colleagues from the same or the IT department, on the intention to adopt. An empirical analysis, using data from 152 firms, based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology and related approaches reveals that social influence on adoption significantly differs with regard to both source (peer groups) and sink (adopters and non-adopters) of the influence. The results imply that a single cumulative subjective norm measure might be too naive and that future research might considerably improve our understanding of IT adoption and non-adoption by revealing the differential impact of various peer groups on adoption intention, and also on its antecedents.},

The IT community in particular has latched on to the concept, although since its inception it has broadened its appeal. This paper discusses the significant issues relating to BPR and makes a distinction between business re-engineering and business process redesign. Based on a study of a number of organizations who claim to be active, the essential ingredients of BPR are presented. The paper then identifies how organizations are managing their redesign initiatives and presents emerging themes. The paper concludes with some of the lessons learned from the research to date and addresses the vital issues of whether BPR is hype, hope or hypocrisy.},

 abstract = {Claudio Ciborra's improvisation argument provides a realistic dynamic account of how organisational practices address technology. This was developed from the study of malleable open-ended technology, but little research has occurred to investigate the theory's validity within different settings. This paper seeks to address this gap, by examining improvisation in the context of a rigid highly structured technology. It presents findings from the successful implementation of an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system within a large international organisation, which was subsequently defined by the ERP vendor as being an ‘exemplary site’. Through the theoretical lens of Actor Network Theory, the paper reveals the improvisation, enactments and constant work around the plan that took place in dealing with the high contingencies of ERP implementation. The study extends the discussion on improvisation and contributes to an already illuminating argument. It invites practitioners to reflect on ERP implementation practice and review their evaluation methods.},

 abstract = {Professor Mumford has contributed significantly to the information system (IS) field. Among her achievements and pioneering thinking is the development of an integrated methodology for systems implementation named Effective Technical and Human Implementation of Computer Systems (ETHICS) that incorporates job design as part of the systems planning and implementation effort. This study questions why ETHICS initially rose in popularity and then declined over the years. To answer this question, we apply Latour's (1999) five-loop framework to describe the formation of science. The findings reveal that Mumford held and aligned many heterogeneous actors and resources that together contributed to the shaping of ETHICS. As the content of ETHICS was shaped by the intertwining of many elements, when some of these elements later changed and undermined their previous alignment, the content of ETHICS was not reshaped, and hence it lost its status and declined.

 abstract = {In recent years, game theory has provided valuable insights into many different types of organizational arrangements. In this paper we investigate some of the ways in which game theory can help us to understand the structure and function of information systems outsourcing arrangements. We provide a brief review of two-person non-cooperative game theory. We discuss the basic concepts of dominance and Nash equilibria. In particular we stress the importance of the information structure of two-person games. We then provide a general game-theoretic interpretation of many key aspects of information systems outsourcing arrangements. In particular, we investigate the rationales behind many of the different ways of determining fees and the effects of the transfer of assets between the outsourcing company and the outsourcing vendor. Finally, we discuss how one particular type of non-cooperative two-person game might be useful as a model of information systems outsourcing arrangements. This model, the principal-agent model, has been extensively studied and in the hands of the authors has provided some initial insights into information systems outsourcing arrangements.},

 abstract = {The integration of business strategic planning and IT has been raised as one of the most important issues facing management in the 1990s. At the same time, there have been spectacular failures when business ventures have sought to exploit information technology. So how does business management go about applying information technology in order to maximize the possibility of gaining success, while minimizing the possibility of failure? Most literature concerned with information technology and evaluation focuses on the evaluation of benefits from the use of a technology. The limited amount of literature which considers the ‘front end’ of the process of selection, as well as implementation of information technology, is more concerned with identifying the business problem areas, the actions of competitors or how to set priorities between projects, than looking at the potential utility of a new or emergent technology. This paper presents a practical methodology which can be used by management to evaluate an information technology and to determine its apparent suitability for their business at this particular time. Its strength lies in the capability of IS management and line managers to quickly and cost-effectively identify the major opportunities for the application of technology to business problems.},

 abstract = {Cognitive automation (CA) moves beyond rule-based business process automation to target cognitive knowledge and service work. This allows the automation of tasks and processes, for which automation seemed unimaginable a decade ago. To organizations, these CA use cases offer vast opportunities to gain a significant competitive advantage. However, CA imposes novel challenges on organizations’ decisions regarding the automation potential of use cases, resulting in low adoption and high project failure rates. To counteract this, we draw on an action research study with a leading European manufacturing company to develop and test a model for assessing use cases’ amenability to CA. The proposed model comprises four dimensions: cognition, data, relationship, and transparency requirements. The model proposes that a use case is less (more) amenable to CA if these requirements are high (low). To account for the model’s industry-agnostic generalizability, we draw on an internal evaluation within the action research company and three additional external evaluations undertaken by independent project teams in three distinct industries. From a practice perspective, the model will help organizations make more informed decisions in selecting use cases for CA and planning their respective initiatives. From a research perspective, the identified determinants affecting use cases’ amenability to CA will enhance our understanding of CA in particular and artificial intelligence as the driving force behind CA in general.},

This paper focuses on a particular aspect of the problem: how organizations appraise IT investments in taking the decision whether to go ahead with them or not. The paper looks first at the different roles of evaluation; second at what is done in practice and third at what might be done given the wide range of techniques that are available and the widely different circumstances in which appraisal is undertaken. A speculative heuristic is proposed for matching an evaluation method with a particular situation. The method is presented in the hope of stimulating further research into the matching problem.},

The problem arises immediately because there are many methods on offer for performing the evaluation and a great number of different situations in which those methods could be applied. There is thus a problem of matching the method to the situation across many dimensions. In the previous paper the authors spelled out some of these dimensions on the basis of empirical work and proposed a matching method derived by trial and error which had, at the time, no theoretical foundations. Further research has suggested a possible rationale and it is that which is presented here, together with a further dimension on which the matching may be carried through.},

 abstract = {With the increasing demand for digitalization, organizations look to emerging technologies such as Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to increase their business performance. This makes it essential to identify and select the most suitable processes to maximize the benefits for organizations. However, despite the increasing interest of academics and professionals in RPA, the literature lacks a study on the main criteria organizations should consider to decide which processes to automate. Therefore, this research lists the main criteria for process automation based on scientific and professional know-how. A systematic literature review was performed, followed by a Delphi study with RPA professionals, to tune the former insights collected from the scientific literature. Our findings point to 32 criteria that organizations and decision-makers should consider before choosing which processes to automate. Feasibility, process description, and input and output data are the most voted. The criteria are evaluated with 18 processes in six organizations with positive results. While professionals may find valuable information in this document to help them decide which processes must be automated first, academics are now aware of which areas deserve further investigation.},

 abstract = {Recent high-profile antitrust cases and policy proposals have put a spotlight on the relationship between firms’ access to big data and sustained competitive advantages in digital markets. In Europe, concerns about data-driven market power have led policymakers to propose far-reaching regulations of information technology (IT) in these markets. Despite the global policy relevance, the regulation of big data and its competitive effects has so far received little attention in information systems (IS) research. This article addresses this research gap by developing an overarching framework for future IS research on the role of IT for the regulation of data-driven market power. The proposed research framework builds upon a three-part analysis: First, we review the academic literature and show that there is extensive, although nuanced, empirical evidence for business value creation from big (user) data. Second, we draw on the resource-based view of the firm and recent policy reports to derive six facilitating factors that enable firms to establish market power based on sustained data-driven competitive advantages. Third, we characterize three regulatory approaches to govern market power and competition in data-driven digital markets: (i) empowering consumers, (ii) data openness, and (iii) limiting data scale. For each of these approaches, we highlight the key role of IT artifacts in mediating the effect of regulatory rules on actual practice.},

 abstract = {Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) is now widely established as an interorganizational system in almost all large and medium size industrial, service and retail sectors and the purpose of this paper is to discuss the experiences of six supermarket chains concerning the use of this technology. Whilst the advantages of conducting electronic transactions are generally recognized, consensus on methodologies for quantifying the benefit success associated with interorganizational systems still remain elusive. It is argued that a comparison of pre-implementation expected benefits with post-implementation realized benefits can offer a reliable way of assessing the benefit success from EDI and other information systems. In this approach, the benefit success is expressed as a function of three benefit states namely, efficiency, neutrality and deficiency depending on whether the gap between realized and expected benefits is positive, neutral or negative respectively. In order to identify the benefit state of each participating organization, initially a series of semistructured interviews was conducted with senior managers followed by the administration of a self assessment rating instrument in the form of a questionnaire. This paper will discuss the findings along with the testing of a new conceptual framework for examining the relationship between benefit success, implementation approach and implementation success.},

 abstract = {We focus on networked arrangements of digital resources that are shared among otherwise independent units to advance conceptual and empirical insights about their governance. We are motivated by the simple observation that, increasingly, independent organizations are engaging in shared activities, often relying on purpose-built digital infrastructures to support this move to inter-dependence. To advance current conceptualizations of networked governance, we draw on data from 42 public safety networks and use fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis. We do so because fsQCA allows us to account for the realities of inter-dependence among the concepts and variables we consider and to illuminate the multiple viable governance patterns that are possible. The results show the importance of network-level governance competencies to manage stakeholders and information infrastructure to achieve high effectiveness of PSN. Analysis makes clear that there exist five configurations of PSN governance practices that enable high levels of network governance effectiveness. Common to all these configurations are the network-level competence in managing both stakeholders and the digital infrastructure, suggesting these are necessary (but not sufficient) network-level governance competencies. Building from the analysis, we advance the role of specific network-level governance competencies, and the current conceptualization of network governance more broadly.},

 abstract = {While the uptake of online communities toward development purposes continues to grow, many are characterized by an unresolved tension. On the one hand, they benefit from participation of heterogeneous stakeholders in their efforts to strengthen their expertise. On the other hand, these stakeholders represent highly diverging interests, which makes collective strategic action very challenging. To understand how online communities cope with this tension, we conducted a longitudinal, mixed method case study of an online community focused on development transportation. We argue that online communities are uniquely equipped, through their fluidity and open-endedness, to enable knowledge creation and agenda-setting. In so doing, online communities afford an ‘intermediary space’ that simultaneously accommodates both convergence and divergence of interests. Our study strengthens the bridge between information systems research and development studies, by highlighting the potential of ICT uptake toward ‘remaking participation’ in development debate, while including the perspectives of heterogeneous interest groups.},

 abstract = {Information technology-enabled business process redesign is a means of levering the power of information technology to change organizational processes radically resulting in substantial improvements in corporate effectiveness and efficiency. Some of the greatest opportunities for organizational improvement using IT are associated with the support of processes that cross functional boundaries. In this search for improvement, it is important to recognize that there are both process risks associated with business process redesign and structural risks associated with crossing functional boundaries. This paper proposes a model that relates the risks and rewards of IT-enabled change and reports on the experience of 59 organizations. The study found that organizations tend to emphasize either cross-functional business process redesign or intrafunctional automation projects. The results suggest that corporations that wish to take advantage of the rewards available from information technology-enabled change should recognize the risks associated with cross-functional change and process redesign.},

 abstract = {In recent years, enterprise system (ES) software markets have been very dynamic. While contemporary customers are increasingly seeking ES solutions that require less and less customization and implementation effort, it is unclear whether all ES providers should take the ‘vertical’ path of offering functionality tailored to specific industries. Given the lack of conceptualization that explores ES markets’ segmentation, this paper offers a typology of generic verticalization strategies. Building on the resource-based view of the firm and the dynamic capabilities perspective, we match ES providers’ organizational characteristics of size and scope with the most effective verticalization strategy. A dynamic dimension is introduced to this framework by analyzing recommended strategies for market entry and growth. Finally, the applicability of the exploratory framework is illustrated using examples from the customer relationship management (CRM) software market.},

 abstract = {Boundary resources have been shown to enable the arm’s-length relationships between platform owners and third-party developers that underlie digital innovation in platform ecosystems. While boundary resources that are owned by open-source communities and small-scale software vendors are also critical components in the digital infrastructure, their role in digital innovation has yet to be systematically explored. In particular, software libraries are popular boundary resources that provide functionality without the need for continued interaction with their owners. They are used extensively by commercial vendors to enable customization of their software products, by communities to disseminate open-source software, and by big-tech platform owners to provide functionality that does not involve control. This article reports on the deployment of such software libraries in the web and mobile (Android) contexts by 107 start-up companies in London. Our findings show that libraries owned by big-tech companies, product vendors, and communities coexist; that the deployment of big-tech libraries is unaffected by the scale of the deploying start-up; and that context evolution paths are consequential for library deployment. These findings portray a balanced picture of digital infrastructure as neither the community-based utopia of early open-source research nor the dystopia of the recent digital dominance literature.},

They are used extensively by commercial vendors to enable customization of their software products, by communities to disseminate open-source software, and by big-tech platform owners to provide functionality that does not involve control. This article reports on the deployment of such software libraries in the web and mobile (Android) contexts by 107 start-up companies in London. Our findings show that libraries owned by big-tech companies, product vendors, and communities coexist; that the deployment of big-tech libraries is unaffected by the scale of the deploying start-up; and that context evolution paths are consequential for library deployment. These findings portray a balanced picture of digital infrastructure as neither the community-based utopia of early open-source research nor the dystopia of the recent digital dominance literature.},

 abstract = {Increasingly, organizations are looking towards IS planning in an effort to force information technology to live up to its heralded promise. Many of these are finding that their efforts are resulting more in disappointment than in organizational advantage. This article reviews the principles of information systems planning and reports the practices found in organizations. The authors argue that these practices lack the high level direction required to achieve mastery in the area. To rectify this, they propose a four-tier planning framework for information technology, information systems, and information management. This framework provides guidance for an integrated approach to the management of an organization's information and technology resources by promoting the development of a planning platform from which consolidated planning can take place at operational, tactical, and strategic levels.},

It is therefore important for the management of such corporations to improve the control and coordination of the corporations’ spatially dispersed subsidiaries. Information technology (IT) has been hailed as an important tool in changing traditional control and coordination processes in complex environments. This paper presents the results of a study that examined the role of IT in the control and coordination of pan-national corporation subsidiaries in Ireland. The findings indicate that IT is being used for changing the nature of the relationship between headquarters and subsidiaries in a manner that makes the pan-national corporation more global in orientation. This is occurring as operations and decision-making processes in subsidiaries are redesigned in order to improve global management and local responsiveness.},

 abstract = {The strategic choices of organizations have traditionally been influenced by their environmental interactions. Consequently, the field of information systems has become increasingly concerned with providing managers with external information. However, such systems are largely based on research that was conducted prior to the important organizational and environmental changes of the late 1980s and 1990s. Much of this research focuses on hierarchical differentiation when providing information (especially external information) to managers. This paper presents the findings of a study that investigated the sourcing, dissemination and use of external information in organizations. The results show that managerial demand for such information is unrelated to managerial level, but is influenced by functional affiliation. The study also contradicts many of the previously held beliefs about managerial preferences for information channels and media. These findings have important implications for the field of information systems, especially personnel involved in systems design.},

This paper presents the findings of a study that investigated the nature and extent of group decision making and the use of group supporting technology in Irish organizations. The paper presents a model of group decision making and examines group processes and activities as well as the use of technology at each stage. The findings indicate that group decision making is a widespread phenomenon, which was found to be far more complicated than individual decision making. However, groups were found to need a great deal of control and coordination to enable members to collaborate effectively. Nevertheless, group decision making was found to receive little technological support. The available technology provided only low level support which mainly focused on supporting the asynchronous work of groups.},

@article{FitzgeraldHowcroft1998a,
 abstract = {The debate between ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ research approaches continues in the IS field, but with little prospect of resolution. The debate is typically characterized by tendentious arguments as advocates from each approach offer a somewhat one-sided condemnation of the counterpart from the inimical research tradition. This paper begins by relating two fictitious tales which serve to highlight the futility of research conducted at the extremity of each research approach. The dichotomies which characterize these rival factions are also summarized. The debate is then framed in terms of the polarization problem whereby IS researchers are divided geographically and paradigmatically into ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ camps. A variety of different strategies have been proposed for resolving the debate and these are discussed in detail. They are grouped into four categories, referred to as supremacism, isolationism, integration, and pluralism. Finally, the paper contends that the debate cannot be resolved, and offers the metaphor of magnetic polarity as a means of reflecting this. The paper concludes by arguing that it would be more appropriate to recast the debate at a macro level in order to accommodate different research agenda and recognize the strengths within each tradition.},

These are identified and categorized in this paper and the results of an empirical study which examined the relevance of these factors in practice are presented. The findings of the study question the relevance and validity of some of the factors that have been identified – most notably that EIS are being introduced at the request of executives who are becoming increasingly computer literate and see EIS as a means of coping with today's extremely competitive business environment. The study findings suggest that IS department push and EIS envy are factors which play a significant role in the emergence of EIS in organizations.},

 abstract = {The reuse of existing knowledge is an indispensable part of the creation of novel ideas. In the creative domain knowledge reuse is a common practice known as “remixing”. With the emergence of open internet-based platforms in recent years, remixing has found its way from the world of music and art to the design of arbitrary physical goods. However, despite its obvious relevance for the number and quality of innovations on such platforms, little is known about the process of remixing and its contextual factors. This paper considers the example of Thingiverse, a platform for the 3D printing community that allows its users to create, share, and access a broad range of printable digital models. We present an explorative study of remixing activities that took place on the platform over the course of six years by using an extensive set of data on models and users. On the foundation of these empirically observed phenomena, we formulate a set of theoretical propositions and managerial implications regarding (1) the role of remixes in design communities, (2) the different patterns of remixing processes, (3) the platform features that facilitate remixes, and (4) the profile of the remixing platform's users.},

The implications of highly-targeted marketing at the individual household level, micromarketing, are examined and it is suggested that supermarkets using such systems would achieve a significant competitive advantage. It is also suggested that the widespread adoption of Vision-type systems would have a profound impact upon manufacturers and the marketing industry as a whole.},

@article{Francalanci2001,
 abstract = {This paper investigates the impact of the technical size and organizational complexity of SAP/R3 projects on implementation effort. Traditional models for predicting software implementation effort tie measures of code size and programming complexity to development time. ERP projects shift a significant proportion of the implementation effort from code development to the parameterization of a pre-existing software package. At the same time, they move complexity from technical to organizational factors since they force companies to adapt to predefined work processes embedded in the software. This paper redefines the concepts of size and complexity for ERP projects and empirically verifies their impact on implementation effort. Specifically, project size is measured in terms of the number of SAP modules and submodules that are implemented, while complexity is defined as the organizational scope of the project in terms of users involved and overall company size. Hypotheses are tested on 43 SAP/R3 projects conducted in a cross-section of manufacturing companies. The findings show that both the technical size and organizational complexity of projects are relevant drivers of implementation effort. The results indicate that implementation effort not only grows with the number of modules and submodules that are selected for implementation, but that SAP is found to require increasing resources to be implemented in larger companies and for a higher number of users, thus indicating that, while there is a technical component of effort that is independent of the organizational breadth of the project, each user adds an organizational component of costs.},

 abstract = {This paper proposes a design methodology of information technology architectures tying organizational requirements to technical choices and costs. The primary goal is to provide a structured support for the selection of the minimum-cost architecture satisfying given organizational requirements. Previous empirical studies have attempted absolute cost comparisons of different architectural solutions, primarily relying on the expertise of practitioners and a priori beliefs, but have rarely taken into account the impact of organizational requirements on costs. Requirements are modelled as information processes, composed of tasks exchanging information and characterized by varying levels of computational complexity. Different architectural distributions of presentation, computation and data management applications are compared. The cost implications of organizational requirements for processing intensity, communication intensity and networking are analysed. The results show a relationship between structural features of information processes and architectural costs and indicate how architectural design should be based on organizational as well as technology considerations.},

 abstract = {Diversity issues in management information systems (MIS) research have received abundant attention over the last 20 years. This paper extends the debate on the limited diversity in the research methods of MIS researchers to include the global research community. The argument of methodological exclusiveness on a global scale is argued to be the result of educational influence on faculty in each region. Leading universities throughout three major regions of the world were evaluated to show the educational influence of faculty causing the expansion of methodological exclusion on a global scale. The paper concludes with recommendations for addressing the issues discussed to further facilitate collaboration among researchers internationally.},

A model of the history of information systems management within user organizations is presented here, which specifies a series of phases the IS field has gone through. Each phase is defined by a critical problem or set of constraints. The phases model can be used to predict new pressures on IS executives and new directions for focusing research and education resources as well as supplementing Nolan's stages model of computer usage within organizations.},

@article{FriskBannisterLindgren2015,
 abstract = {Failed or partially failed information systems (IS) investments continue to be a problem in both public and private sectors. Although there are many causes of such failure, lack of clarity about the goals and benefits expected and how they are to be realized is one of the major contributors. This is particularly so in the public sector where the purpose of IS investment is not to increase profits, but to accomplish social and political goals. One way of reducing failure and wastage rates is to have ex-ante evaluation. Over the past three decades IS research has proposed a plethora of new theoretical approaches to improving ex-ante evaluation, but with a few exceptions, these have had little impact on practice. This paper presents a way to address this gap between theory and practice. It proposes a way in which managers can improve IS investment evaluation by changing perspective from a focus on traditional analytic tools towards a design attitude that seeks to develop multi-criteria IS evaluation approach based on contextual experience and prior knowledge. The proposed approach enables organizations to design and develop a value case using value dials as a common language that defines what constitutes the value of particular IS investments for a specific context. To assess its effectiveness, this approach was applied using a multilevel dialogical action research project within a Swedish public organization. The findings show that managers in this organization significantly improved the effectiveness of their evaluation of IS investments.},

 abstract = {With this article, we contribute to the recent debate regarding the role of transaction cost economics in IT outsourcing and software development outsourcing research. Our focus is on the contract-type choice for short-term software development outsourcing. For this purpose, we critically examine transaction cost economics and the extant IT outsourcing/software development outsourcing literature and propose a framework which classifies software development outsourcing transactions according to transaction frequency and transaction investment characteristics. The framework identifies short-term software development outsourcing as an occasional, idiosyncratic transaction. Based on this groundwork, we clarify the concept of short-term contract and put forward that such a transaction is governed by a short-term contract. Following transaction cost economics and control theory, our resulting theoretical considerations infer that for short-term software development outsourcing, the vendor’s high human asset specificity and the resulting behaviour-based outcome control, the monitoring of the developer staff, are the triggers for contract-type decisions. Accordingly, staff monitoring by the client should result in Time & Material contracts, whereas staff monitoring by the vendor should result in Fixed Price contracts. We develop corresponding hypotheses which we test with 468 specific contract records for short-term software development outsourcing. The results confirm the transaction cost economics–based recommendations for contract-type choice. We therefore conclude that the advice of the transaction cost economics to use certain governance structures according to transaction attributes is also applicable to IT outsourcing/software development outsourcing transactions. We suggest further exploration of specific contract records to substantiate our results.},

The survey mirrored similar research that has been undertaken in the USA and elsewhere, thus enabling international comparisons in the future. The aim of this paper is to provide comparisons of (i) the views expressed by IS executives vis à vis those with a ‘non-IS’ role and (ii) the findings of this study with those of a previous similar British study undertaken in 1987.},

 abstract = {In this paper we argue that electronic data interchange (EDI) should not be viewed simply as a technological infrastructure, but as a technology which may enable an organization taking a strategic view to derive comparative advantage from utilizing it as part of a process of business re-engineering – in other words, as a sociotechnical entity. We suggest that strategic information systems planning (SISP) is a suitable superstructure within which EDI implementation may be considered from an appropriate strategic, as opposed to tactical, perspective. Finally we describe the theory and current practice of SISP and present guidelines for its application in relation to EDI.},

 abstract = {National initiatives for the development of information infrastructure have become critical to moving nations into the information age. In this paper, we are concerned with the features of information infrastructure development strategy, the social determinants for a country to choose a strategy and the principles of its design. We investigate China's telecommunications market transformation over the last two decades. China's experience is interesting as it is a case par excellence of a large transitory economy. We observe that China's national strategy was based on multiple social elements, not on technological prerogatives alone. This suggests that a national strategy for infrastructure construction should be derived from carefully considering both the technological options available as well as the social and political environment and the situation in the market structure.},

The influence of Social Networks has entered the Customer Relationship Management domain under the coined term CRM 2.0. In this context, the need to understand and classify the interactions of customers by means of new platforms has emerged as a challenge for both researchers and professionals worldwide. This is the perfect scenario for the use of SEMO, a platform for Customer Social Networks Analysis based on Semantics and emotion mining. The platform benefits from both semantic annotation and classification and text analysis, relying on techniques from the Natural Language Processing domain. The results of the evaluation of the experimental implementation of SEMO reveal a promising and viable platform from a technical perspective.},

A summary review of work in the related topics is conducted. The proposed model of technological transfer includes a provision for the development of a new taxonomy of work tasks targeted for technology applications. The model also incorporates a matrix framework for representing a match between the generic components of work tasks, typical engineering projects, generic components of technology, and specific self-contained technologies. A validation procedure for application within an industry targeted for technology transfer is outlined.},

 abstract = {Mobile information technology (IT) holds great promise to support managerial processes; however, clear guidelines of how to design effective mobile Information systems (IS) for use by managers are still lacking. Building on earlier research studies of task-technology fit (TTF) and other areas of IS, this article presents a three-step conceptual model to establish fit between managerial tasks, mobile IT, and the mobile use context, assuming that a good fit positively impacts task performance. We find that use situations characterized by high distraction and poor quality of network connection are particularly challenging for the design of mobile IS, and that the user Interface requires particular attention. Our model contributes to IS research by joining disparate streams of research in an effort to help advance our understanding about the development and utilization of mobile IS. From a practical perspective, we contribute to the success of mobile IS and to the effectiveness of mobile work as It becomes increasingly prevalent in our modern world.},

 abstract = {This paper offers a paradigmatic analysis of digital application marketplaces for advancing information systems research on digital platforms and ecosystems. We refer to the notion of digital application marketplace, colloquially called ‘appstores,’ as a platform component that offers a venue for exchanging applications between developers and end users belonging to a single or multiple ecosystems. Such marketplaces exhibit diversity in features and assumptions, and we propose that examining this diversity, and its ideal types, will help us to further understand the relationship between application marketplaces, platforms, and platform ecosystems. To this end, we generate a typology that distinguishes four kinds of digital application marketplaces: closed, censored, focused, and open marketplaces. The paper also offers implications for actors wishing to make informed decisions about their relationship to a particular digital application marketplace.},

@article{Gianchandani2011,
 abstract = {The number of people afflicted with chronic illnesses such as obesity, cancer, and diabetes has soared in recent years, generating new kinds of disparate medical challenges. In turn, these challenges have resulted in skyrocketing costs, preventable deaths, and medical malpractice claims. For example, studies have found nearly half of all US patients receive inadequate care each year, over 2 million are harmed by hospital-acquired infections, and over 1 million suffer disabling complications during surgery – even though half of these are thought to be avoidable. These challenges have catalyzed the beginning of a transformation in care delivery, from a health-care system that focuses on disease to one that must look after patients – including individuals and communities. To provide proper treatment to those who are chronically ill, the health-care system has to support improved individuals’ health-related practices prior to the manifestation of disease; ensure that a range of practitioners can deliver quality clinical care during the onset of an illness; and facilitate patient-provider-family partnerships during post-disease wellness care. As we describe in this review, key advances in networking and information technologies – spanning patient monitoring, data visualization and decision making, robotics and computer vision for diagnosis and surgery, social networking for fostering community-based support systems, and so on – stand to drive forward these changes. Together with social scientists, systems engineers, medical practitioners, and computer scientists, information systems scholars can help alter the nature of care delivery well into the twenty-first century, ultimately contributing to a system that is much more safe, effective, reliable, and timely than it is today.},

 abstract = {This paper is concerned with the computerization of the primary health care sector in the United Kingdom. This care is provided by family doctors, known as general practitioners (GPs). The sector has been transformed in the years since 1986 by a series of legislative changes. These changes have had profound implications for the information requirements of GPs. They have led to the widespread adoption of computerized patient record systems by GPs rising from less than 25% before 1988, to greater than 75% by 1993. The paper considers evidence from a variety of historical surveys and combines this with first-hand experience drawn from working to implement information technology (IT) in the National Health Service (NHS) and through a set of interviews carried out for this study. It seeks to evaluate the process up to the present and to identify critical factors relevant to both practitioners and IT professionals who are increasingly involved with the NHS in the UK. Finally, it makes recommendations for both health and IT professionals on the future IT needs of general practice.},

The major empirical component is a case study looking at the impact of computers on health promotion activities among over 1 million patients in Lancashire. Finally, the paper looks forward to the latest NHS reforms, as outlined in the 1997 White Paper The New DHS (Department of Health, 1997, HMSO, London) and outlines the information implications and a strategic framework to deliver changes required if the reforms are to succeed.},

@article{GleasureOReillyCahalane2017,
 abstract = {The number and scale of crowdfunding platforms has increased dramatically in recent years, arguably more so than any other open phenomenon. This increase has allowed several crowdfunding websites to capture significant public attention, e.g. Kickstarter, Indiegogo. Yet, the growth of these specialist websites is only one aspect of the increasing popularity of crowdfunding technologies. Another, less-commonly discussed development is the propagation and integration of crowdfunding technologies into novel hybrid or proprietary production contexts, such as t-shirts (e.g. Threadless) or video games (e.g. Star Citizen). Such integrations are to be expected as crowdfunding technologies grow and evolve. However, they also present new challenges for managers and system designers, as the manner in which different features of crowdfunding technologies are enacted becomes decreasingly predictable the more their application domains diverge. This study performs a socio-material case study of Unbound, an innovative book publisher based in the UK. Unbound uses crowdfunding technologies to help authors raise the funding necessary to publish their books. However, once this funding has been reached, Unbound assumes more typical publisher responsibilities, such as editing, printing, binding, shipping, and promoting these books. Findings from Unbound identify four categories of socio-material practices in this hybrid model, each of which contains multiple sub-practices enacting different material features. This includes practices for fundraising, practices for maintaining traditional publishing standards, practices for creative contribution by backers, and practices for motivations. Further, tensions are observed for each of these categories of practices, due to the conflicting demands for inclusivity and selectivity associated with crowdfunding and publishing, respectively.},

 abstract = {Digital platforms have proven to be efficient matchmakers in our networked economy and society. However, their tremendous potential is a double-edged sword, and concerns about their malpractices and negative impact have risen remarkably. In the light of practical relevance, research on digital platform regulation (DPR) did not contribute very much. Especially information systems (IS) which, as a discipline, seems predestined to explain the problems at the confluence of technology–economy–society, has barely grazed the issue of DPR. Particularly, a contribution is missing that at least explores the problems with digital platforms systematically and comprehensively. In response to this aim, we pursue a two-step approach: First, we apply qualitative meta-analysis of 211 cases as well as a number of regulation papers and actual regulation endeavors to identify and conceptualize the problem scope and potential regulatory approaches for platform problems. Second, we condense our findings into a conceptual model. Our findings show that digital platforms exploit both platform- and monopoly-related problems to assert themselves in different markets. Through their impactful platform governance, they even have become serious challengers to the regulator in controlling market access, key conditions, and resources. At this, they rely on the efficient use of data and digital technologies to effectively orchestrate platform agents and their transactions. The outcome of the paper is a set of two structured instruments that fill a void in interdisciplinary research and provide support to DPR practitioners for a systematic approach to regulation.},

 abstract = {Knowledge management is an increasingly important source of competitive advantage for organizations. Knowledge embedded in an organization's business processes and an employee's skills provide a firm with unique capabilities for delivering a product or service to customers. Law firms represent an industry which seems very well suited for knowledge management investigation. Law firms are knowledge intensive and the use of advanced technology may transform these organizations in the future. To examine knowledge management in Norwegian law firms, a study which involved two phases of data collection and analysis was designed. The first phase was a field study of the largest law firm in Norway. The semi-structured interviews conducted in the initial field study documented a strong belief in the potential benefits from knowledge management. The second phase was a survey of Norwegian law firms. Firm culture, firm knowledge and use of information technology were identified as potential predictors of information technology support for knowledge management in law firms in Norway. The extent to which law firms in Norway use information technology to support knowledge management is significantly influenced by the extent firms generally use information technology.},

 abstract = {Increasingly, people are turning to social media to express grief. By and large, however, the social media community can do little more than improvise reactions, not quite sure how to use the old familiar social scripts as guides to lending effective support. To examine the role of social media in the grieving process, we used a mixed-methods approach: 12 interviews with “social media grievers” reveal the expectations of the bereaved regarding other users’ behavior. By way of two online experiments with 1058 participants, we tested how these expectations are met by the messaging of social media providers in accordance with social norm theory. We found that injunctive social norm messages are particularly effective, whereas descriptive social norm messages vary in their effectiveness, depending on which information is presented and how prominently so. What our study shows, then, is that both are potent socio-technical tools that can guide users towards more empathetic behavior when dealing with the bereaved, so while social media may not be a substitute for therapy, they can offer profound comfort for those of us dealing with bereavement and grief.},

@article{Grant2003,
 abstract = {This paper explores the issue of strategic alignment and enterprise systems (ES) implementation from the point of view of one organization involved in deploying an enterprise resource planning system globally. Two questions motivated this research. First, given that strategic information systems (IS) alignment is viewed as essential to organizational success in deriving value from information technology (IT) investments, what is the experience of organizations in practice in aligning their IT strategies with their business strategies? Second, what is the impact of global ES deployments on strategic IS alignment? Based on an in-depth case study of one organization's experience, the research shows that achieving alignment is still important yet difficult to attain. The pressure for alignment may be even more intense with the deployment of global enterprise-wide systems. The study provides additional empirical support for the strategic IS alignment construct and goes further to suggest that deploying an ES does not by itself create integrated and seamless operating environments. In addition, such an outcome requires significant organizational change at all levels.},

@article{Gregor2014,
 abstract = {This commentary responds to Avison and Malaurent's (A&M) interesting perspective on the role of theory in qualitative articles published in information systems journals. A&M raise valid concerns with journal norms in respect to acceptance of novelty, tolerance for triviality, possibly unethical behaviour, and, implicitly, accepted epistemological practices for theorizing and theory development. Although I share many of their concerns about journal practice, I have serious concerns that readers will view their paper as attacking theory-in-itself despite the authors’ protestations they are not doing so. The guidelines they advance could promote the idea that theory-free articles are acceptable, which I see as a dangerous path for our field. I believe we should be focusing more on the theorizing process and underlying epistemological issues. In this way, we can view and justify new and surprising ideas and interesting empirical findings in single articles against a backdrop of ongoing theory development in the field as a whole.},

@article{Grimshaw1992a,
 abstract = {Many academic and practical traditions have been brought to bear upon the field of business information systems in an attempt to understand a rapidly changing subject. The insights provided by traditional disciplines to an essentially multi-disciplinary subject is essential and very healthy. However, there is a danger of proliferating many different, overlapping frameworks of information systems. There is a need to review the frameworks and suggest a way of integrating several approaches. The future research effort depends upon a consistent set of data being available and discussed. This paper reviews previous frameworks used to promote the understanding and discussion of information systems. The one-dimensional approach is rejected in favour of a three-dimensional approach built around three basic questions characterized as the three Ts. What tasks does the information system have to perform? What technology can best deliver the systems? In what timeframe are we operating? The paper concludes by suggesting an integrated taxonomy, based on the three Ts as the basis for future research and discussion.},

We also find that information systems research converges on a few broad research areas, and there is increasing diversity of topics within these broad themes. Concerning level of analysis, our results indicate a decreasing trend toward macro (organizational) studies. Finally, we note a lack of positive significant trends in the publication of special issue articles, review articles, and meta-analytic studies.

Given the diversity and complexity of these technologies, it is surprising that they have been the subject of precious little empirical research. This study examines the use of these technologies in American businesses. The data suggest preliminary patterns along which these technologies can be structured to facilitate both practice and research.},

 abstract = {Information technology (IT) has become a strategic resource for many firms today. Coordination of this resource requires strong leadership and cooperation within the firm. The relationship of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the Chief Information Officer (CIO) is crucial for the effective, successful utilization of IT for competitive advantage. This paper first explores the CIO position, giving reasons for its development, tracing its evolution, and pinpointing certain responsibilities associated with the position. The paper then highlights the CIO's concerns and identifies the future implications for the CIO. The second portion of the paper takes the CEO's perspective towards IT and the CIO's position. Special attention is directed towards describing the CEO's perspective on the CIO's qualifications, addressing the problem of overblown CEO expectations for the CIO position, and discussing ‘old-line’ CEOs’ attitudes towards IT and the CIO position. Also addressed is the exploration of the common CEO perception of the CIO as an ‘empire builder’ and an analysis of the CEO's perspective on the future need for a CIO position. Finally the paper focuses on developing this ‘strategic partnership’ between the CIO and the CEO. Suggestions are provided for the CIO and the CEO to help achieve this ideal partnership. Although these suggestions are not all conclusive, they are critical to the ‘partnership’.},

However, much of the emphasis placed today in systems development under prototyping focuses on the supporting technology. The imbalance between product and process perspectives under this approach is explored. A view of prototyping effectiveness is presented in terms of non-linear problem solving, adequate technical and procedural solutions, and organizational support. Implications of this view are presented on the selection of prototyping techniques and on project management concerns. Future developments in prototyping practice are explored.},

 abstract = {The ISU design model is an ‘architecture’ designed to support a human resource approach to information systems development. The model emerged in a live project for a large local government client, and its particular shape derives from four major areas of concern: (1) quality, and the strategic management of resources; (2) client-led management of information systems development; (3) IT-related labour market issues and equalization of employment opportunities; and (4) human-centred approaches to the design of technology systems. This article develops a working definition of human-centred design practice, indicates key practices in implementing the architecture, and identifies key concepts in interpreting the ‘feel’ of the approach. As a human-centred model, it is essentially about learning, and the article refers to three concepts of organizational learning which informed the design work.},

@article{Hamilton1999a,
 abstract = {Surveys during the past two decades have consistently shown that many of the most critical management concerns with information systems arise at the portfolio, rather than application, level. Architecture-driven planning with a view to the implementation of integrated information systems structures has been widely canvassed as a means of dealing with portfolio-level issues, particularly the problems of inconsistent data and uncoordinated processes which have affected many organizations in recent years. The benefits anticipated from this type of initiative have been such that many organizations have persisted with architecture-based strategies despite reports of high failure rates. This paper reports on some research into IS integration planning in the organization Telstra (formerly Telecom Australia)) during a period of 40 years. The research was conducted as an interpretive case study, with practitioners’ assessments and perspectives on IS planning being incorporated in the data analysis. The focus of the study was on four critical assumptions, which were identified during an initial review of the theoretical literature as having to hold true for an organization to expect success with this form of planning. The study revealed that none of these assumptions held reliably throughout the period studied, a point fundamental to understanding why relatively little progress was made towards published integration targets. The paper then canvasses the view that though traditionally understood as blueprints for implementation, information systems architectures could be reconceptualized as knowledge assets, with independent value as sources of core planning concepts. The conclusion drawn is that their use in this type of role could facilitate the achievement of many, if not all, of the benefits anticipated from more comprehensive approaches.},

@article{HansethLyytinen2010,
 abstract = {We propose a design theory that tackles dynamic complexity in the design for Information Infrastructures (IIs) defined as a shared, open, heterogeneous and evolving socio-technical system of Information Technology (IT) capabilities. Examples of IIs include the Internet, or industry-wide Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) networks. IIs are recursively composed of other infrastructures, platforms, applications and IT capabilities and controlled by emergent, distributed and episodic forms of control. II's evolutionary dynamics are nonlinear, path dependent and influenced by network effects and unbounded user and designer learning. The proposed theory tackles tensions between two design problems related to the II design: (1) the bootstrap problem: IIs need to meet directly early users’ needs in order to be initiated; and (2) the adaptability problem: local designs need to recognize II's unbounded scale and functional uncertainty. We draw upon Complex Adaptive Systems theory to derive II design rules that address the bootstrap problem by generating early growth through simplicity and usefulness, and the adaptability problem by promoting modular and generative designs. We illustrate these principles by analyzing the history of Internet exegesis.},

On the one hand, the demands of increased competitiveness are forcing technical experts to gain better understanding of the commercial requirements of the end users they serve, and on the other hand, the opportunities offered by the End-User Computing phenomenon are placing increasing demands on the technical capabilities of the end users themselves. The emerging picture is one of a highly dynamic IS profession, with expanding boundaries, fewer barriers between itself and other professions and offering greater opportunities for those entering it and increased challenges for those already in it.},

@article{Harris1996a,
 abstract = {This paper uses a ‘case in sector’ analysis to investigate the extent to which the success criteria imposed by cost accounting constrains the ability of engineers to acquire and make effective use of computer aided design (CAD). The paper examines two periods of CAD investment in a sample of UK manufacturers. In the first ‘early adoption’ period CAD proposals were made by junior engineers on a locally initiated ‘bottom up’ basis. Proposals were made according to the dictates of conventional cost benefit analysis, engineering and accounting priorities were separate, and senior management were not involved. In the second ‘general adoption’ period there was a general uptake of CAD throughout the sector. The paper demonstrates that the evaluation of CAD was influenced not just by the rival claims of accountants and engineers, but also by long run changes in the operating environment, and by the control devices employed by senior management. The findings bear out the view of technological change as a socially negotiated process. However, it would appear that the oranizational practices associated with CAD evaluation are continually re-negotiated in the light of dynamic organizational interests and changes in the broader sectoral context.},

 abstract = {“Social process’ analyses of technology implementation have had a major influence on research carried out over the last 15 years. Technology implementation is now widely regarded as a ‘socially negotiated’ process the outcome of which is likely to be shaped by different interests and constituencies within the innovating firm. However, the explanatory status accorded to questions of power and political process remains problematic. This paper combines an empirical investigation of the political processes associated with the implementation of CAD/CAM with a cross-disciplinary treatment of the underlying theoretical issues. The concluding part of the paper focuses on ‘political’ and ‘learning’ aspects of technical change. ‘Power’, ‘knowledge’ and ‘control’ rationalities are included in a revised theorization of the technical change process.},

@article{Heaton1998a,
 abstract = {The past decade has seen the development of a perspective holding that technology is socially constructed. This paper examines the social construction of one group of technologies, systems for computer supported cooperative work (CSCW). It compares the design of systems for computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) in Scandinavia and Japan with particular attention to the influence of culture on the resulting products. Two case studies are presented to illustrate the argument that culture is an important factor in technology design, despite commonly held assumptions about the neutrality and objectivity of science and technology. The paper further proposes an explanation for why, despite similar technical backgrounds and research interests, CSCW design is conducted differently and produces different results in Denmark and Japan. It argues that, by looking at CSCW systems as texts which reflect the context of their production and the society from which they come, we may be better able to understand the transformations that operate when these texts are ‘read’ in the contexts of their implementation.},

 abstract = {Most software projects take place in a volatile environment in which many dangers exist that may affect the successful outcome of the project. After completion of the project an evaluation may show that many of the problems encountered during the project could have been foreseen before they actually occurred. Risk management is an approach that is aimed at predicting the occurrence of this type of problem and at taking counter measures to either prevent them from affecting the project or to soften their impact. In this paper the basic activities related to risk management are described. Furthermore a concrete method aimed at supporting risk management is presented. This method has been used successfully in practice. Some of the results obtained by using it are presented on the basis of five cases. Some conclusions are that: (1) the use of a short and structured checklist will ease identification of and discussions about risks, (2) a risk management method in which explicit use is made of a group related approach, involving all parties, will increase reliability and acceptance of the results, and (3) involvement of a neutral process risk advisor will further both the successful use of the method and the acceptance of the results.},

 abstract = {The paper addresses the human resource issues associated with the implementation of IT into the Production facilities of a company operating in the process industry. The primary focus of the research is a field study based on a questionnaire issued to the process workers who would be most affected by the changes. Management was initially concerned that resistance to change could pose a significant problem. In this respect there was particular concern that the age and background profile of the workforce could exacerbate any underlying tendency to change resistance. This paper evaluates the background to these concerns and illustrates how this particular organization dealt with them. The questionnaire results indicated a very low level of initial familiarity with any form of computer based technology. Nonetheless the results indicated a very positive response to the IT implementation proposals with virtually no evidence of attitudinal rigidity. In this sense, the results broadly support many of the observations revealed in the literature.},

This emphasis on greater quality is paralleled by the management philosophy known as Total Quality Management (TQM). Based on the common theme of ‘quality’, parallels are drawn between the OO and TQM philosophies in order to optimize on the benefits to quality software engineering offered by the object-oriented approach.},

@article{Hendriks2001,
 abstract = {Several applications of information and communication technology (ICT) have gained considerable popularity as instruments for knowledge management. Some authors even seem to equate knowledge management with the introduction of specific ICT applications (intranets, groupware, etc.). However, the relationship between ICT and knowledge is no less problematic. Organizational knowledge and ICT refer to distinct sets of conceptions and establishing their relationship is far from trivial. The question then is how to assess the relationship between ICT and knowledge management. Several variables to be considered when answering this question have been identified in the literature: the enabling role of ICT for knowledge processes, the state of the ICT infrastructure, the level of knowledge required for using ICT, other user considerations, etc. However, a more encompassing perspective connecting these individual variables seems to be lacking. The aim of the present paper is to correct this. It argues that five dimensions determine the potential value of ICT applications for knowledge management. These dimensions are summarized in the following question. How and when will ICT, in interplay with other knowledge management measures (dimension 5), help knowledge (dimension 2) as a dynamic (dimension 4), institutional and action-related resource (dimension 3) realize its strategic potential (dimension 1)? The main argument in this paper is that, unless all five dimensions are addressed together, no satisfactory assessment of the status of an ICT application as a potential tool for knowledge management is feasible. Each of these dimensions is of a complex, multidimensional nature. The identification of the five dimensions is therefore only a first step. It needs a follow-up in the form of an elaboration of each dimension. This paper provides the groundwork for such an elaboration.},

@article{HenfridssonMathiassenSvahn2014,
 abstract = {Inspired by Herbert Simon's notion of nearly decomposable systems, researchers have examined modularity as a powerful approach to manage technological change in product innovation. We articulate this approach as the hierarchy-of-parts architecture and explain how it emphasizes decomposition of a design into loosely coupled parts and subsequent aggregation of these into an industrial product. To realize the scale benefits of modularity, firms successively freeze design specifications before production and therefore only allow limited windows of functionality design and redesign. This makes it difficult to take advantage of the increased speed by which digitized products can be developed and modified. To address this problem, we draw on Christopher Alexander's notion of design patterns to introduce a complementary approach to manage technological change that is resilient to digital technology. We articulate this approach as the network-of-patterns architecture and explain how it emphasizes generalization of ideas into patterns and subsequent specialization of patterns for different design purposes. In response to the increased digitization of industrial products, we demonstrate the value of complementing hierarchy-of-parts thinking with network-of-patterns thinking through a case study of infotainment architecture at an automaker. As a result, we contribute to the literature on managing products in the digital age: we highlight the properties of digital technology that increase the speed by which digitized products can be redesigned; we offer the notion of architectural frames and propose hierarchy-of-parts and network-of-patterns as frames to support innovation of digitized products; and, we outline an agenda for future research that reconsiders the work of Simon and Alexander as well as their followers to address key challenges in innovating digitized products.},

 abstract = {In response to their growing importance, digital infrastructures (DIs) are increasingly subject to governmental regulation due to concerns over the downside risks posed by digital technologies to individuals and society. There is a general paucity of studies that address the impact of regulations on DI innovation. In addition, existing research presents seemingly contradictory findings on regulations governing digital technologies as both enabling and inhibiting innovation. This paper, therefore, elaborates on how different types of regulation impact various forms of DI innovation. We draw on modular systems theory to enrich extant conceptualisations of DIs and develop a related conceptual model that demonstrates the paths by which two types of DI regulation influence DI architectural modularity, which is proposed as a mediating mechanism that influences DI innovation. Our model makes a theoretical contribution through an in-depth explanation of the relationship between regulation and DI innovation by articulating and illustrating the effects of regulatory provisions and thereby extends the extant DI literature. In terms of practical implications, our model can help stakeholders both create DI regulation and respond to regulatory provisions.},

 abstract = {For three decades, research has investigated the role of information systems integration (ISI) in mergers and acquisitions (M&As). This research has improved our understanding of the M&A IS challenges and their solutions. However, consolidation and integration across the research is limited. To redress this omission, we review 70 articles published between 1989 and 2016. To do this, we adopt and extend the methodology developed by Lacity and her colleagues to review the empirical evidence in a fragmented IT literature. We code 53 dependent variables and 195 independent variables to identify the robust relationships among them and to model how ISI decisions, including the choice of IS integration methods, partially mediate the effects of the independent variables on ISI outcomes. Examining the relationships in this model, we identify five quasi-independent thematic domains on which we draw to develop an agenda for future research. Our contribution is the aggregation, organization and structuring of the empirical findings in the M&A ISI literature as a basis on which to develop a cumulative knowledge process.},

 abstract = {In virtually every information systems (IS) project, control is exercised on multiple hierarchical project levels. For example, senior managers exercise control over project team leaders, who in turn exercise control over distinct groups of project team members. Most prior studies have exclusively focused on one specific controller-controllee dyad. As a result, there is little understanding of how IS project control is exercised across different hierarchical levels. To close this research gap, we conducted a case study of a large IS project at a major engineering firm. Our study helps enrich the traditional mode-based typology of control with the dimension of control style, that is, the distinction between enabling and coercive control. Our research contributes novel insights to the IS control literature in three ways: (1) we find that the senior management level and the project management level differ in the use of control style but not in the use of control modes, (2) we identify several factors that influence the choice of a particular control style, and (3) we find that senior managers can influence project activities on lower levels by implementing controls that can be readily emulated by project leaders as well as transmitted through hierarchical levels with little distortion.},

 abstract = {This case describes how Siemens Power Corporation, a Richland, Washington, USA-based manufacturer of nuclear fuel assemblies, came to adopt and implement SAP's R/3 application suite, the world's leading enterprise resource planning (ERP) package. The case introduces the reader to the type of decision making related to an ERP adoption and implementation and provides some interesting examples of factors which may influence actual decisions and outcomes. Among other things, the case touches on the following issues: the relationship between restructuring (re-engineering) and software adoption and implementation, the choice of package software, the pros and cons of alternative implementation approaches (‘big bang’ versus ‘phased'), the selection of hardware and the value of consultants. By January 1999 Siemens Power Corporation's (SPC's) restructuring project was more than 2 years under way. To SPC's top management's great relief, the company had made major progress ever since SPC's German parent Siemens AG hired a consulting team to help SPC get back on its path towards profitability. In particular, the largest and riskiest of its individual restructuring subprojects – SPC's SAP R/3 implementation – seemed on the way to becoming a success.},

 abstract = {Digital transformation (DT) offers organizations the opportunity for operational and strategic innovation, leading to increased efficiencies and transformative changes. However, successfully implementing DT initiatives requires collaboration among diverse stakeholders with varying perspectives, motivations, and capabilities. This study explores how stakeholders frame the DT process to achieve alignment and implement DT initiatives. Drawing upon the concepts of frames and frame alignment mechanisms, the study examines how stakeholders strategically influence each other’s interpretations through frame alignment mechanisms. A case study of a council-wide DT initiative in an Australian city council was conducted to analyze stakeholders' strategic alignment efforts. The findings reveal differing interpretations of the DT process among stakeholders and the strategic efforts to align the various interpretations through a frame transformation of planning, implementation, and communication frames. Based on the findings, a process model for achieving alignment in DT initiatives is proposed, capturing the dynamic nature of frames and their interactions. This study contributes to the understanding of stakeholder dynamics and strategic framing in the context of DT initiatives.},

Guidelines were collected to assess the true costs of deploying IT, taking into account technological costs, human costs and organizational costs. By identifying examples of best practice, an evaluation methodology was then developed which concentrates on both the primary objectives of systems and on the inevitable second-order effects resulting from the broader human and organizational impact. The methodology is eclectic in that it matches specific evaluation techniques to distinct classes of IT projects.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the effects of four determinants of vendor profitability in enterprise resource planning (ERP) outsourcing projects under two contractual regimes: fixed price (FP) contracts and time and material (TM) contracts. We hypothesize that effect sizes are larger under FP contracts than under TM contracts. From a transaction cost economics perspective, we hypothesize that project uncertainty and project size are negatively associated with vendor profitability. From a knowledge-based view of the firm perspective, we hypothesize that industry knowledge and client knowledge are positively associated with vendor profitability. We tested these hypotheses on a comprehensive archival data set comprising 33,908 projects from a major vendor in the ERP software market. Our results confirm and extend previous research. Our results support the existence of two contractual regimes: effect sizes on vendor profitability are indeed much larger in FP contracts than in TM contracts. Also in line with prior research, our results suggest negative effects of project uncertainty and project size in terms of project budget on vendor profitability and positive effects of industry knowledge on vendor profitability. Contrary to prior knowledge, we find that project size in terms of project duration is significantly positively associated with vendor profitability in FP contracts. Also contrary to what is known, we find a significant negative effect of client knowledge on vendor profitability in both contractual regimes.},

The translation services market provides rich examples of networks in practice that connect a diverse range of customers who require translation services to a global array of translators ranging from individual experts through to organized groups. This paper examines the marketing strategy of a global translation company, Thebigword. In the case of Thebigword, the network is constructed around shared information systems that encapsulate and define the nature of relationships with both business customers and thousands of individual translators worldwide. The marketing problem for Thebigword is that it must be able to sense and react to changes and requests from large business customers around the world, whether this is a change to their website, or a request for a new document translation. In the financial services market, the request for translation services may also be very time sensitive. The focus of the paper is on how Thebigword has used information systems to create a smart business network that defines marketing channels along the key dimensions of target market, business processes, IT architectures and systems, and network intelligence. A range of business examples is presented that illustrate how the marketing and information technology concepts fit together, including that of an international bank and an airline company. The case also provides technology examples of portal technology, web services and e-procurement.},

 abstract = {Much effort and research has concentrated on the need to formulate and implement business strategy, and the need to monitor performance against strategic plans. This paper, based on research carried out from July to September 1990, identifies the methodologies which organizations applied to define performance indicators presented on their Executive Information Systems and if these indicators helped steer the organizations towards their strategic objectives. Organizations applied either a critical success factor, an alternative top-down, or an evolutionary/prototype methodology to build their EISs. Unfortunately, not one organization which took part in the research modelled its EIS on its overall business strategy, thus limiting the use of their EIS to that of a glorified fire extinguisher rather than using it to help bridge the gap between formulating and implementing a business strategy.},

 abstract = {Information technology poses many challenges both to general management and to the IT industry itself After extrapolating some of the technological trends that could have significant impacts on commercial and public sector IT in the 1990s, the paper reviews four major challenges. These are the need to develop IT strategies, both nationally and for individual organisations; the need to create alliances; the need to avoid misalliances; mechanisms for converting ideas into action. A considerable emphasis is placed on the need to understand the managerial environment within which IT is used, and to see IT as only one element within wider organisational systems.},

 abstract = {While recent surveys suggest that capital budgeting systems in business organizations continue to become more formalized and sophisticated, a constraint on the use of sophisticated capital budgeting techniques seems to be the degree of support provided by firms’ capital budgeting information systems (CABIS). This paper, based on a survey of 146 large firms, outlines the current status of CABIS and their usage pattern. It was found that although two-thirds of sample firms have specific computer application systems for capital budgeting, most CABIS are relatively unsophisticated and less than adequate in providing the information and decision support capabilities required to use sophisticated capital budgeting techniques effectively. In particular, the barrier and problems encountered in the use of probabilistic risk analysis were explored. Implications of these findings are discussed.},

 abstract = {This paper considers the application of the technology acceptance model (TAM) in explaining intranet usage in two organizations. The TAM was originally developed for explaining technology acceptance and has since been successfully applied to a number of technologies. Its suitability for modelling intranet use is considered here. The model is tested in two UK companies from the banking and engineering sectors. Study 1 finds that the TAM may be valuable as a tool for helping with analysing and understanding intranet usage. The second study indicates that its applicability may be variable between intranets and demonstrates that self-report and actual measures of usage are not interchangeable when applying such a model. The findings have implications for previous and current research employing the TAM and for intranet research in general.},

 abstract = {The 3DayCar programme reveals the principle source of delay during the order fulfilment process in the automotive industry as information processing not manufacturing. This suggests that information and communication technologies (ICT) are crucial in re-shaping industry structure towards customer responsiveness and building to order. This paper reports on the findings of a longitudinal study during a critical period for the industry where firms adopting web-enabled ICT seek to increase inter-organizational collaboration and gain competitive advantage over other supply chains. In all, 75 interviews across 28 firms examine the adoption of business-to-business (B2B) e-procurement and supply systems by vehicle manufacturers (VMs) and suppliers. Forms of organization are represented as a map of industry structure showing supply relationships and firm affiliation to B2B applications. VMs have tended to adopt a short-term price-driven approach using e-hubs and webEDI (electronic data interchange) in their attempts to control cost. Suppliers are concerned over an apparent disregard for firm autonomy, particularly those who have launched ICT projects of their own. Recommendations for the future are considered in light of what such large-scale efforts imply for design, deployment, and uses of ICT in industry settings.},

Four distinctive categories of organizational usage of CASE are proposed, and the count of responding companies in each of these categories is given. Diagramming aids were found to be the most used CASE tools, with reverse engineering tools least used. The authors model innovation as a two-phase process and present factors from the study that are most often found in systems departments that are successful in each of these innovation phases.

@article{Howells1997a,
 abstract = {This paper will show how the UK banks learnt the strategic value of retaining IT expertise in-house through their experience of the design of EFTPOS networks. The banks began by attempting to ‘buy-in’ IT expertise from other organizations, but they were first compelled to locate expertise in a jointly-controlled organization called EFTPOS UK, then forced to develop the new IT expertise within their existing IT departments. These manipulations of the ‘organizational location’ of expertise gave individual banks the ability to create their own technology strategies, which they promptly exploited in an attempt to gain competitive advantage. It will be argued that a greater capacity to form individual technology strategies and exploit competitive advantage will result from the active management of two other dimensions of expertise: these are termed the internal location and the individual partition of expertise. The first term refers to where in the organization technical expertise is located and the second to how technical expertise is divided between individuals. The process by which the individual partition of expertise changes is called the hybridization of expertise and it is argued that although this is to an extent ‘natural’ it may certainly be managed. The case for a more aggressive and explicit expertise strategy, including the active management of the process of hybridization, is made by reference to the nature of the network design and practices in the management of technical expertise in other industries.},

 abstract = {This study reports on the experience of the First Atlantic Bank of Nigeria as it embarked on the implementation and introduction of Internet and mobile banking services. Based on the concept of a logic of opposition the study conceptualizes the case company's effort with a specific emphasis on the mode and impact of learning that occurred intra- and inter-organizationally. The case considers how being a first mover in a given market can be crucial, not necessarily because of the immediate commercial benefit, but more because of the opportunity for developing customers’ trust in order to ensure the success of future innovations. In addition, the case illustrates the problematic nature of evaluating the success or failure of an innovation. Further, it shows how failure can be an intermediate step to future success, while making the point, counter-intuitively perhaps, that blindly listening to customers may prove to be a barrier to successful innovations. Thus, firms might capitalize from what might initially be perceived as failure, in particular through transforming an opposing force into a promoting one.},

 abstract = {The digital transformation of the FinTech industry has revealed a plethora of significant challenges for industry decision makers and wider stakeholder groups as organisations contend with the onset of new regulatory frameworks, legacy systems, flexible business models and alignment with corporate social responsibility practice. The reshaping of organisations and drive to greater levels of decentralisation and employee centric practice, presents a cultural shift for the sector, with implications for the success and resulting benefits of change across the industry. This study aims to develop novel insight to the ‘lived in’ impact of digital transformation within the FinTech industry from a factor interdependency perspective. This research adopts a mixed methods approach incorporating Interpretive Structural Modelling, Analytical Hierarchy Process and interviews with expert participants, to offer a unique perspective on the challenges and unintended consequences of industry level technological change. The findings highlight the high levels of interdependency and priority for challenges related to the investment in products and infrastructure for new markets, criticality of stakeholder support and development of a digital mindset for the adoption of new technologies.},

We argue that this places an onus on systems developers to be both explicit in their assumptions and critically reflective in their thinking.},

 abstract = {When developing an information system, organisations are faced with a fundamental choice: to buy a pre-developed package (potentially customise it or redesign/reengineer the business processes of the company concerned to fit the package), or to build the system in-house. Past literature has indicated the importance of the buy vs build decision to the organisation even suggesting that correctly managing the choice could be the key to managing IT. This research aims to identify the factors that an organisation should consider when making an information systems buy vs build decision. Interviews were conducted with 10 organisations across a spread of industries, involving key strategic IT decision-making personnel at the senior IT executive level. By examining the operational approaches adopted in each of these organisations and the key drivers behind these approaches, we identify the core factors that affect real-world buy vs build decisions in large Australian organisations with a turnover in excess of $750 million. We found that a number of core factors - strategy, commodity and competitive advantage, maturity, cost and requirements fit - critically affect buy vs build, while peripheral factors - risk, time and timing, political factors, and ongoing support - are secondary considerations.},

 abstract = {Every business executive in every industry throughout the world is facing increasing and unrelenting competition. During the past decade this growing competition has brought with it the associated threat of survival of so many enterprises at a time when we are also experiencing the effects of a new industrial revolution created by the continuing and rapid advancements in information technology. In this paper we present the argument that the key to corporate success is associated with the development of the effective management of IT. The expenditures involved are now so large that they must be the concern of the Chief Executive Officer of the company. But, as we demonstrate, this is not the current situation in many organizations. The challenge of the ‘90s will be to integrate in an effective manner, the corporate business strategy with the increasing use of IT. In many cases, it will require a new style of management, but for those organizations who do not make this change, their corporate prosperity may be at stake. This paper sets out my personal view on this major issue, which was presented on the 23 April 1990, as the British Computer Society 1990 Jubilee lecture and sponsored by Computer Weekly.},

 abstract = {The continuing growth of business activities in companies has been in parallel with the increased use of IT to support the basic business processes and assist in generating further commercial advantages for the organization. Business growth has been generated through a natural expansion of the core activities, acquisition of other companies which has often resulted in working practices of geographically separated organizations, divisions and subsidiaries maintained to preserve their successful business culture. The role of the central IT department as the most cost-effective organization to support the business led use of IT is now in question in many companies. In this paper we present the argument that the key to corporate success is associated with the effective management of IT. In many cases, this will require a new style of management with vision and commitment from the CEO. But for those organizations who do not make this change, their corporate prosperity may be at stake.

 abstract = {The emerging new breed of IS (group decision support systems and decision simulation, multimedia, next-generation knowledge-based systems, deductive databases and DBMSs, and such like, together with the evolving networking capabilities) will have a more significant impact on the way people work than have ‘conventional’ IT products. This will have implications for what one might call the ‘cognitive style’ of the user interaction. This paper describes further a view of the organization of organizations that has already been sketched briefly elsewhere (Hutchison & Rosenberg, 1993; Hutchison, 1994), and proposes a strategy for the formal modelling of cooperative group work.},

 abstract = {Ignoring the informal, non-canonical nature of knowledge sharing, including people's motivation, ability and opportunity to share knowledge, is one of the key causes of resistance to use knowledge-sharing tools. In order to improve knowledge sharing supported by information technology (IT), tools need to be embedded in the social networks of which it is part. This has implications for our knowledge on the design requirements of such socially embedded IT. The paper reviews tools that are designed for the purpose to foster social capital. We will then discuss what is needed for an IS design theory related to knowledge communities and how such a theory could incorporate social capital theory.},

 abstract = {This case summarizes a failed systems development project at Green Valley Hospital. The project was part of a large strategic information systems plan aiming to lower costs, improve the quality of patient care and re-engineer the hospital's operations. To implement the project, the president of the hospital selected a $5.9 million system by Ibax. The users, who felt that the selected system did not satisfy their needs, rejected it during the testing process. As a result, the project was abandoned 3 years after its initiation.

 abstract = {Focusing on inter-organizational information sharing in criminal justice, it is found that, while poor project management leads to unsuccessful inter-organizational information sharing, a recipe for success is more demanding as it requires both compatible technologies and good project management implemented either by means of a top-down approach of strategic alignment or an emergent approach of bottom-up alignment. Though unplanned, the latter approach may lead to mistakes that are more correctable than the large mistakes stemming from top-down, deliberate planning. The study is an analysis of context-mechanism-outcome configurations of inter-organizational information sharing activities within criminal justice systems and demonstrates the causal asymmetry between positive and negative cases. Theoretical, methodological, and practical implications are discussed by highlighting the causal role of different types of governance structure in a crisp set configurational fashion.},

Computer capacity planning (CCP) provides them with a tool to assess the future computing needs and new technologies. Effective CCP is an important step in providing users with the lowest cost solution that meets their computing requirements. This paper discusses the definition and methodologies of CCP. The importance of CCP for IS people as well as business people is emphasized. Five phases for developing a capacity plan are presented and a few examples for illustration are provided. A real life example is also presented and suggestions and recommendations are offered.},

@article{IgnatiadisNandhakumar2007,
 abstract = {Enterprise systems are used to facilitate the seamless integration and exchange of data between the various departments within an organization. In order to achieve this, rigidly defined control mechanisms must be in place in the system, which safeguard the company's data and protect the company against unauthorized and unintended uses of the system. This is ideal for total control; however, is only achievable to a certain extent. The configuration of controls in the enterprise system may have unintended organizational implications, due to organizational necessities. The purpose of this paper is to present the findings from a company case study, where an enterprise system is being used. We suggest that the introduction of an enterprise system creates power differentials, which serve to increase control in the organization. This results in increased rigidity, and a possible decrease in organizational flexibility and resilience. On the other hand, enterprise systems can also cause drift, resulting from the unexpected consequences of these power differentials, as well as from the role of perceptions of people in solving a problem within the enterprise system. This reduction in control may serve in some circumstances as an enabler to organizational resilience.},

 abstract = {The DP/MIS function has traditionally been concerned with the acquisition, manipulation and delivery of internally generated data. Typical reporting systems are unable to cope with a mixture of short term control information and broad strategic information, as well as information generated from external sources. The move to a distributed environment has led to a need for the management of information flows, and specifically with the management of integrated data, often directed at the very top levels of management. There has been a recognition of the need for a formal information management programme and in response to this a new type of information professional is emerging - one trained specifically in the management of information as a corporate resource. This person may well have different skills from a systems analyst, possibly more oriented towards improving the efficiency of operational procedures. The information management profession must understand the technology, especially in the communications area, must be able to sell to and educate at various management levels and be able to formulate and implement a plan for increasing the effectiveness of the use of the information resource.},

 abstract = {This paper examines the ways in which to conduct planning for information services (IS) so that both computing and business problems may be addressed in an integrated fashion. It traces the evolution of IS planning from a more reactive mode, with a steering committee deciding on future directions, to a value-added approach where incremental components of a total IS product are offered to user managers for consideration. This helps overcome problems with the strategic planning process itself which is both incremental and cyclical. The organisation often focuses on a direction, only to change as the economic environment or market conditions change. The IS function consequently must move away from plans set in concrete in spite of implementation difficulties associated with that approach. The problem is one of aligning the IS plan with an often mobile corporate plan. In order to respond to this situation, there has been a move towards a marketing of IS services, so organisations can avail themselves of IS opportunities that are within the capabilities of the IS function to deliver.},

 abstract = {This paper describes a category of information systems called ‘Soft information systems’. Basically these lie between conventional information systems in which data are well defined, and management support, and decision support systems. A soft system is a system which operates on soft data. Such data cover categories of information such as conjectures, predictions, feelings and opinions and are typically found in systems where there is some element of anticipation of the future. Such systems include career counselling systems, where clients have rather ‘fuzzy’ views of what they might wish to do, through to economic based systems used to predict levels of employment, inflation levels and interest rates etc. In between are management-type systems in which it is normally assumed that hard (i.e. factual) data are used, for instance in budgeting systems. The paper describes some previous work and the experimental systems which tested and explored the ideas involved as well as attempting to refine some of the techniques that can be used to deal with soft data.},

The paper looks at the various reasons that led to X.400's failure to gain the widely expected level of market acceptance. A brief literature review suggests that common explanations for success in a standards battle cannot explain the demise of X.400. The same holds for two popular explanations for the victory of Internet over OSI. Therefore, alternative reasons are proposed and discussed, including poor timing of the standardisation activity, inadequate first implementations, and an ill-advised paradigm shift that occurred in the cause of events. Finally, some lessons to be learned for the future are identified.},

 abstract = {The global digital divide is usually measured in terms of differences between rich and poor countries in the extent to which they use ICTs in general and the Internet in particular. Such a view of the problem, however, ignores the fact that there are all kinds of ways in which poor, illiterate persons in developing countries benefit from the Internet without any use of computers and Internet connectivity. Most of these benefits occur as a result of intermediaries who, in one way or another, transfer relevant parts of the knowledge available from the technology to recipients in a form that is relevant to their specific needs. Using India as an illustration of this argument, we find that usage understates actual beneficiaries by at least 30 percent. On the basis of this finding, we suggest that a reconstrued notion of the digital divide be based on usage as well as other more indirect forms of benefit from the Internet in developing countries. To this end, much more needs to be known about these other forms of benefit in a large sample of countries in addition to India.},

 abstract = {Defined as the differential extent to which rich countries and poor countries benefit from various forms of information technology (IT), the global digital divide has been extensively measured and described in national as well as international debates. The problem, however, is that the topic is highly fragmented in the literature, with few attempts to put the parts into a coherent analytical framework. More precisely, there has been no specific attempt to pinpoint the main issues that influence one's view of the importance of the digital divide and the policies demanded by the different points of view. The goal of this paper, accordingly, is to fill this important gap in the literature in an analytical schema that recognizes the ways in which the impact of innovations depends heavily on how they are generated and diffused. At each stage of this sequential process are key issues that influence one's view of the digital divide. It matters a great deal for instance on whether the divide is in some sense unique, or just another manifestation of the general technological relationship between rich and poor countries. It is also the case that the size of the divide depends heavily on how it is measured. Yet another example is that the extent of the potential impact of IT will influence our view of the foregone opportunities associated with limited uptake of this technology in developing countries.},

 abstract = {This paper aims to provide insights into strategies for teaching information systems. Key strategies discussed include the development and use of computer case studies, interviewing corporate information systems management, use of appropriate guest lecturers, project work within organizations, and research into current technology issues. These strategies arc illustrated with reference to the teaching of two postgraduate subjects. New technology may be appropriated to the teaching of information systems namely the use of Self-Monitoring And Reactive Tutoring Systems (SMARTS). These systems will include elements of intelligent tutoring systems, artificial intelligence, hypermedia, information tracing and students’ thought processes. A framework outlining the objects or elements of a SMART and their relationships is presented as an initial guide to researchers interested in further development of these technologies. Mention is also made of an experiment underway in the USA on customized text book publishing which provides tailored resource material chosen by the lecturer for a particular subject which is then published as the customized text for that subject.},

 abstract = {This paper investigates the impact of knowledge based information systems (KBIS) on commercial organisations. A questionnaire and interview format was used to gather information from eleven commercial organisations developing KBIS. Three prime areas were considered, namely knowledge acquisition, knowledge representation, and KBIS development methodologies. For each of these areas, the normative position as expressed in the literature is presented and then compared to the survey findings. Problems involved in the development of KBIS are mentioned as well as developers’ perceptions of the future directions for KBIS within their organisations. Additional information on each organisation is presented in an Appendix in order to provide a richer picture and background to the study. The main preliminary findings are that KBIS have made an impact on organisations in Australia who are willing to make a considerable investment of resources in this new venture. While most organisations are treating this technology as research and development, they believe that the technology will be absorbed into their mainstream information systems in the future. These systems are seen as providing a competitive edge to those organisations willing to make the investment.},

 abstract = {Understanding of consumer experienced value in mobile services continues to be a strategic issue in the information systems literature. This is no different with Mobile TV that has become feasible with the convergence of telecommunication infrastructures, computer technology, and media content services. Mobile TV offerings are defined as real-time broadcast transmissions of content to mobile devices. We review mobile services literatures on consumer value creation and identify a gap in our understanding of how supplier firm's consumer-focused strategies may aid in consumption processes and thereby increase payments from consumers. We apply the perspective of consumer benefits experienced (CBE) to provide insight into how supplier firms may be able to increase consumer value. Value increases with greater consumer service-specific knowledge, and leveraging and complementing this knowledge across different offerings. Increased service-specific knowledge can also reduce demands on the consumer that can create important switching costs while increasing consumer-experienced value.

 abstract = {The paper expands theoretical and empirical understanding of capabilities development in the mediated offshore outsourcing model whereby a small or a medium-sized firm delivers offshore software services to a larger information technology firm that in turn contracts and interfaces with the actual end-client onshore firms. Such a mediated model has received little prior research attention, although it is common particularly among Chinese firms exporting services to Japan, the largest export market for Chinese software services. We conducted case studies in four China-based software companies to understand the mechanisms used to develop their operational capabilities. We focused on client-specific, process, and human resources capabilities that have been previously associated with vendor success. We found a range of learning mechanisms to build the capabilities in offshore firms. Results show that the development of human resources capabilities was most challenging in the mediated model; yet foundational for the development of the other capabilities. This paper contributes to the information systems literature by improving our understanding of the development of operational capabilities in small- and medium-sized Chinese firms that deploy the mediated model of offshore software services.},

Lessons from the experiences of the business sector of developed countries are useful if adapted to the situation. End-User Computing (EUC) has been recognized to have potentially the greatest impact on productivity and on the efficient use of resources in developed countries. The experience of developing countries in introducing IT is reviewed. Based on the stage hypothesis model of growth in computing, a framework to analyse and predict EUC growth in the health sector of developing countries is described. Using the structure, people and technology parameters of the framework, benchmarks applicable to the health sector in developing countries for each stage are applied to case studies from the Asia-Pacific region. The utility of the framework in identifying key issues that need to be addressed in planning information systems in developing countries is presented.},

The impact of outsourcing drivers including efficiency, IS alignment and the human resource dimension are explored and balanced against the perceived outsourcing risks. It is also postulated that although managers claim rational economic benefits, when making outsourcing decisions, they may, in fact, be bounded in their rationality by their perception of the quality experienced as users of IS/IT. Hence, it is suggested that the real justification for outsourcing may be that it provides a definitive, albeit drastic, vehicle for change.},

@article{JensenKjrgaardSvejvig2009,
 abstract = {Institutional theory has proven to be a central analytical perspective for investigating the role of social and historical structures of information systems (IS) implementation. However, it does not explicitly account for how organisational actors make sense of and enact technologies in their local context. We address this limitation by exploring the potential of using institutional theory with sensemaking theory to study IS implementation in organisations. We argue that each theoretical perspective has its own explanatory power and that a combination of the two facilitates a much richer interpretation of IS implementation by linking macro- and micro-levels of analysis. To illustrate this, we report from an empirical study of the implementation of an Electronic Patient Record (EPR) system in a clinical setting. Using key constructs from the two theories, our findings address the phenomenon of implementing EPRs at three levels: the organisational field, the organisational/group, and the individual/socio-cognitive level. The study shows how a rationalised myth of an efficient EPR system has travelled from the organisational field to the hospital ward and on to individual doctors. The findings also provide evidence of a strong human agency by showing how doctors enact their work practices and shape the use of the EPR system. The study contributes to IS research by showing the need to address macro-level structures, as well as individual interpretations and practical use situations, in order to identify how and why information systems are adopted by users.},

 abstract = {This study examines the adoption of business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce by bricks-and-mortar companies comprising the Standard & Poor's 500 (S&P 500) listings between 1992 and 2003. B2C represents a Type III information systems (IS) innovation that integrates IS with core business technologies. Extant studies on Type III innovations have examined organizational and institutional factors, solely or collectively, in explaining adoption, but not how their effects change under shifting environments over time. We develop an integrated model comprising organizational factors (i.e., espoused values and resources) and institutional factors (i.e., normative and mimetic pressures), as well as the moderating influence of shifting environments (i.e., early period and late period demarcated by changes in the environment). Using a piecewise event-history model specification, we examine the adoption of B2C innovations by 93 organizations over time. Our results show that both organizational and institutional factors influence B2C adoption; however, their effects varied with the environmental shifts. Specifically, senior IS executives influenced adoption in the early period whereas bandwagon mimetic pressures and business norms influenced adoption in the late period. The findings of our research demonstrate the importance of explicitly modeling environmental shifts in theorizing organizational adoption of innovations.},

 abstract = {We present a review and analysis of the rich body of research on the adoption and diffusion of IT-based innovations by individuals and organizations. Our review analyzes 48 empirical studies on individual and 51 studies on organizational IT adoption published between 1992 and 2003. In total, the sample contains 135 independent variables, eight dependent variables, and 505 relationships between independent and dependent variables. Furthermore, our sample includes both quantitative and qualitative studies. We were able to include qualitative studies because of a unique coding scheme, which can easily be replicated in other reviews. We use this sample to assess predictors, linkages, and biases in individual and organizational IT adoption research. The best predictors of individual IT adoption include Perceived Usefulness, Top Management Support, Computer Experience, Behavioral Intention, and User Support. The best predictors of IT adoption by organizations were Top Management Support, External Pressure, Professionalism of the IS Unit, and External Information Sources. At the level of independent variables, Top Management Support stands as the main linkage between individual and organizational IT adoption. But at an aggregate level, two collections of independent variables were good predictors of both individual and organizational IT adoption. These were innovation characteristics and organizational characteristics. Thus, we can consistently say that generic characteristics of the innovation and characteristics of the organization are strong predictors of IT adoption by both individuals and organizations. Based on an assessment of the predictors, linkages, and known biases, we prescribe 10 areas for further exploration.},

 abstract = {The increased digitalization of work results in practices that are increasingly networked and knowledge-based. As such, we need to continuously inquire how digital technology leads to changes in work and not be content knowing that it leads to change. This paper contributes to advancing such knowledge through an analysis of digitalized condition-based maintenance of machinery in a Swedish iron ore mine. Drawing on the distinction between digital representation and digital meditation figurations of human and material agency, we analyze how the distributed network of workers used a diverse portfolio of digital technologies to make complex knowledge-based decisions on when and how to maintain the mining machinery. We combine these empirical insights with extant literature to advance a new theoretical perspective on how key characteristics of digital technologies are implicated in networked, knowledge-based work practices.},

 abstract = {Offshoring of services will shape the economic landscape for the coming decades, and present opportunities and challenges for individuals, organizations, and countries. Many countries are jostling in the global services marketplace to take advantage of the emerging opportunities. The success of an organization's offshoring initiative depends critically on the selection of a right destination; a wrong choice may result in a failure and impose significant costs. This paper presents a framework to assess the attractiveness of a target country, which identifies various motivating, inhibiting, and facilitating factors that may influence its attractiveness. The framework is used to analyze the future attractiveness of India, a topic that continues to be debated. The relative attractiveness of other potential competitors for offshoring of services is also discussed. Contrary to other analysts’ opinions, we conclude that India is likely to sustain its leading position for a long time in the services sector, and that it is likely to emerge as a global hub for the delivery of services, analogous to China's role in the manufacturing sector.},

 abstract = {This paper views information technology (IT) outsourcing decisions as classical make-or-buy decisions. In essence, these decisions consist of finding an acceptable balance between benefits and risks. The principal contribution of this paper is the development of a model that describes the relationship between outsourcing benefits and risks. It draws on work from two streams of research: transaction cost theory and modern financial theory. The model can assist managers in determining whether outsourcing or in sourcing is a better choice for a particular IT function and in evaluating and comparing competing vendor proposals. The model can also serve as a framework for future research in IT governance issues.},

@article{KaiserBuxmann2012,
 abstract = {This papers shows that the management of contractual relationships in IS/IT outsourcing is not only receiving greater attention in academic research, but that it has also moved into focus of companies with high outsourcing degrees. This shift of management attention is accompanied by observable changes in IT organizations’ design, revealing an underrepresented but promising research topic. While prior research has predominantly explored single aspects, for example, supplier selection or relationship building, this article takes a more holistic approach on IT supplier relationship management (SRM) with a focus on organizational design. A conceptual framework, covering three core elements of organizational design, strategy, structure and process, guided the multiple case study on IT SRM in five client IT organizations. One key finding from sourcing strategy is that IT organizations have in parts significantly and abruptly reduced their number of suppliers in the last years, a phenomenon typically well known in the automobile industry. With regard to structure, different organizational models are presented, varying upon their degree of centralization and mode of sourcing. The concept of a hybrid (centralized-decentralized) structure, where a central unit fulfills SRM activities, was shown to be the predominant model within our case organizations. Design and potential benefits of this barely examined model are discussed in detail and empirical examples are provided respectively. As a third organizational design component, formal processes and lateral connections are presented as a means to bridge barriers between organizational entities central to IT SRM. Finally, various opportunities for future research are illustrated.},

 abstract = {Although there is extensive literature on IT/IS-business alignment, we argue that the topic's current research trajectory is limited given the concept's predominantly static focus to date. While the process perspective on alignment is a promising avenue to study the phenomenon's dynamic nature, we still know little about what it is that organizational actors actually do, on a day-to-day basis, to align IS and related concerns with business imperatives. In order to address this lack of understanding regarding the practices of aligning, we argue for research that goes beyond abstract macro analysis of alignment processes to that which considers the actual micro practices of aligning. An analysis of the extant literature on the topic leads to the identification and classification of aligning activities that are being undertaken in practice. We argue that this review and critical appraisal of the IT/business alignment field has the potential for substantive and insightful contributions to our understanding of alignment as it is enacted – in practice. Arising from the review, we discuss important new research themes that are to be addressed if research on alignment is to be demonstrably relevant.},

 abstract = {The advent and growth of recent discussion on business process re-engineering (BPR) has been accompanied by its increasing application to a myriad of research areas and approaches. This paper examines its tenets using sociological and organizational paradigms and investigates its significance for software geared to enhancing coordinative and cooperative working methods and relationships within organizations. By taking the experience of implementors of such software and using a grounded and interpretive approach, initial conclusions suggest that BPR concepts have an impact for large scale and highly structured working activities but seems to have an interestingly inverse relationship with information-oriented cooperative and user-enhanceable approaches to process coordination and improvement. Taking these themes, this paper outlines some conceptual interpretations and theoretical managerial considerations for cooperative/coordinative and process work flow implementations.},

The challenges of managing this project were considerable because there was significant social diversity amongst the e-leaning community members. The paper outlines some key principles derived from teleology (or, the ‘study of purpose’) that were used to structure some key aspects of the management of the e-learning group processes. These principles were developed and used, in order to structure enquiring activities to inform the design, monitoring and evaluation activities in the provision of e-learning group processes. The paper outlines the use of such enquiry as a foundation for the continued development of the application of e-learning in contexts in which divergent human groups come together in unstructured, non-prescriptive human learning activities. As such, the paper outlines some key methodological requirements for managing e-learning group processes.},

@article{KawalekLeonard1996a,
 abstract = {This paper addresses the issues of software development in situations of organizational and process change. There is wide agreement in the literature that organizations have to be increasingly flexible in order to survive in the current economic climate. They must innovate, replicate, adapt and extemporize. As they do so, the requirements they have of their software applications are likely to change. Equally, as new software solutions are provided, new opportunities for business change arise. The situation is made still more complex because even if the needs of organizations were stable, we still could not be certain of the validity of an application's functions. This is because the process of program development is inherently uncertain. From this situation arise difficult, practical challenges for those concerned with the deployment of software in organizations. Starting with a consideration of the nature of organizations themselves, this paper takes looks at these problems by moving between three related points. It looks at software development methodologies and suggests that these have in the past tended to assume that discrete IT solutions can be cast for a ‘steady state’ which the organization is attempting to achieve. From the second vantage point it looks at the role of IT staff in supporting the operational needs of the organization. The third is the nature of software systems themselves.},

 abstract = {This paper is concerned with the emerging role of management accountants in the formulation, development and implementation of information strategies within organizations. The paper is both empirical in that it is based on survey data and theoretical as it postulates future developments. The essence of the argument is that management accountants have adapted to information technology and have been active in exploiting data processing systems since their inception. This experience and knowledge of the technology alongside their managerial abilities form powerful tools to enable their participation in developing information strategies. The development of an information strategy enables the matching of technology, information content and managerial activity to achieving the overall business strategy in the face of uncertainty. This clearly follows the proposal of accounting process to manage environmental uncertainty reflecting Lorange and Scott-Morton (1974), Hedberg and Jonsson (1978), Hedberg al. (1976) and Earl (1983).},

The study is balanced between a research enquiry and the consulting process with the client being the trade association. Following initial case study investigations, a postal questionnaire survey was undertaken of member organizations and individuals within them. Hard and soft data were collected about organizational structure, information systems and their characteristics, and users’ perceptions. The findings emphasise the importance of user attitudes pre- and post-implementation, and their involvement during the systems analysis and design phases.},

@article{KellyNoonan2008,
 abstract = {In this paper we focus on the neglected role of anxiety and psychological security in organizational life, specifically in the context of the organization and development of offshoring relationships that extend across time and geography. In contrast with much of the literature on offshoring (and inter-organizational relationships more generally), which tends to take a very conventional rational decision-making perspective on the phenomenon in question, we emphasize the less tangible, emotional dimensions. In particular, we are concerned with understanding the processes by which clients, who have little or no previous experience of offshoring, may develop and sustain adequate levels of psychological security to enable them to bracket risk and productively engage in such unfamiliar and alien work arrangements. To this end, we draw on Anthony Giddens’ distinctive, non-cognitivist conception of trust, supplemented by other important contributions in the area, to explore the processes by which a sense of psychological security and stability is achieved in the face of the quotidian anxieties provoked by engagement in these contemporary modes of global organizing. Our synthesized theoretical framework is developed and illustrated in the context of an ongoing, in-depth, longitudinal study of the evolution of an Ireland-India information systems offshoring relationship. By tracing the dynamics of this relationship over an 18-month period, we examine the practices (or ‘relationship work’) through which trust is produced, and suggest that different mechanisms can be discerned at different (albeit overlapping) stages of the relationship. In the earlier phase, the emphasis is on the role played by care and attentiveness in producing a sense of trust in the qualities of the supplier. As the relationship develops, however, the emphasis shifts to the production of a stable collaborative order. Here, we focus on the micro-political dynamics of such processes and draw attention to three important tactical interventions (brokerage, signaling, and the ‘third man’). We conclude by arguing that the sense of trust that was carefully cultivated in the earlier phase of the relationship provided a crucial foundation, which not only facilitated the subsequent development of a stable collaborative order but, most noticeably, helped contain a serious crisis that beset the project in December 2006.},

Information architecture design can produce a stable IA capable of supporting existing as well as improved business processes. Reciprocally, business process redesign (BPR) provides a high profile business justification for the IA endeavour. Given proper collaboration between corporate and IT strategic planners, both BPR and IA efforts should produce a number of valuable common outputs. These include the identification of business processes within an organization, the prioritization of these processes based on their strategic relevance, the establishment of process performance measures, and the modelling of these processes and their supporting information resources. A synergistic model of IA and BPR is presented and selected IA techniques and modelling methods are recommended. Future research is suggested concerning the need to test the relationship between BPR and IA.},

@article{KhanJarvenpaa2010,
 abstract = {The coordination of a social event requires a number of time-bounded tasks (exact time, location, activities of the event) to be determined prior to the event. On university campuses, Facebook is increasingly used to organize ad hoc physical gatherings within social groups. The coordination takes place via Facebook event pages and a ‘wall’ that represent online, shared, interactive spaces. This paper explores how such online interactive spaces facilitate the temporal coordination of social events. We content analyze Facebook's event pages and walls to understand how social group behavior is different from prevailing theories of group task progress and media use. The results suggest that, similar to many work groups, social groups exhibit differential interactive behaviors before and after the midpoint of when the event is created on Facebook and when the offline activity is going to happen. However, the results differ in the sense that the interactive behavior is highest before rather than after the midpoint. We also found that the involvement of the creator of the event pages is associated with higher interactive behavior of the social group. We discuss the findings and derive implications for the design of online tools for social event management.},

 abstract = {Once an organization has adopted packaged software, upgrades to newer versions are inevitable. Anecdotal reports suggest that software upgrades are extremely costly and may not bring actual benefit to stakeholders in the organization. Because software upgrades recur periodically, it is important to understand the impacts of software upgrades on organizational stakeholders. In this study, we examine the impact of packaged software upgrades from the perspectives of IS staff and IS users. A dual case study was conducted to understand the impacts of an SAP upgrade and a Windows upgrade. Our study shows that there are two essential costs in each upgrade, the cost of implementation and the costs of users’ learning. Moreover, not all users experience positive impacts from software upgrade. Users’ experience of beneficial impact is contingent upon users’ explicit adoption of useful new features and improvement in features that users use.},

 abstract = {The e-marketplace, or broker-managed online market, is one of today's most profitable e-business models. In these marketplaces, buyers routinely engage with businesses and individual sellers with whom they have had little or no prior interaction, making trust one of the most important issues in the e-marketplaces. Therefore, a clear understanding of the trust building process in the e-marketplace is important for the success in the market. In this study, we analyze the process by which e-marketplace customers develop trust in both a market-maker and sellers. Additionally, this analysis provides a theoretical framework to identify the antecedents of trust. In the framework, we suggest that the impact of trust on transaction intention is moderated by the customer's previous experiences in the e-marketplace. The theoretical model presented here was tested on survey and transaction data collected from 692 respondents. The results indicate that customers value the importance of trust in the market-maker and sellers differentially by the level of transaction experience. It is also shown that market-maker's characteristics (reputation, website's usability and security) and seller's characteristics (expertise) play an important role in the formation and development of trust toward a market-maker and sellers, respectively.},

 abstract = {Mobile data services (MDS) are wireless value-added pay-per-use services that have attracted increased attention in recent years. In this paper, a theoretical framework is proposed to investigate key drivers of user behavior in wireless pay-per-use services based on a value perspective. This study examines the role of three evaluation criteria -utilitarian, hedonic, and social values - in adoption decisions. Potential adopters have no direct experience with MDS; thus, they likely conceive value based primarily on indirect experience with it, such as through communication with peers or advertisements. In this study, the influence of members in the social networks and external sources are regarded as the major sources of information in order to capture the role of these factors on the perceptions of value. Additionally, according to the age and gender of potential adopters, changes in the degree to which the antecedents lead to MDS acceptance are examined. The proposed model is empirically tested using survey data collected from 287 potential adopters. The analysis results show that the proposed model, based on the aforementioned view of value, provides a significant explanation of the variance in the level of adoption intention toward MDS. The results of this study indicate that utilitarian and social values dominate adoption decisions, whereas the impact of hedonic value in MDS acceptance is weaker than other values. Information from relevant others and from mass media play a critical role in forming the perceptions of value obtained from the use of MDS. The results also shed light on the moderating effects of age and gender on MDS acceptance. Theoretical and practical implications of this work are discussed.},

A field study was undertaken to evaluate and test the relationships via structural equation modeling using LISREL. The path from performance expectancy and user satisfaction to IT utilization was positive and significant. While the path from implicit social influence to IT utilization was found to be significant, explicit social influence had no significant influence on users’ IT utilization.

 abstract = {Business process re-engineering (BPR) was presented as the key to successful organizational transformation in the early 1990s. In this paper we examine a BPR initiative at a medium-sized UK building society in order to explore whether BPR succeeded or failed and to place BPR within the wider context of an organization facing a merger. The study describes the development of a novel BPR methodology which combines both hard and soft modelling approaches and reveals a degree of success in terms of process modelling and gaining consensus on process content and faults. However, two more far-reaching initiatives served to drain away support from the BPR effort: a parallel organizational analysis undertaken by an external consultancy and the hidden (although rumoured) merger talks with a larger partner. Therefore it is inappropriate to view BPR as an isolated, strategic initiative when, in practice, it may be one of several competing change activities vying for support within a changing organizational context. The paper concludes by presenting a model of concurrent dynamics which helps to explain why BPR lost momentum.},

To enable comparisons to be made, two versions of the system were built; one in prolog and one in an inexpensive expert system shell. The systems were designed to relieve lecturers by providing answers and explanations for examination questions in the area of standard costing. The experiments show that such simple systems can be developed by lecturers for their own use, although there are limitations, especially in the knowledge which can be captured. Testing of the system in practice has shown benefits in terms of reduced lecturer load and positive responses from students. The experiments show that integrating simple expert systems into the education process can be beneficial when the technology is adapted to match the educational requirements.},

Structures, as evidenced by 14 case studies and the words of six financial directors, are defined here as organizational responses, including user committees and responsibility accounting, quantitative assessments of IT projects, such as financial appraisals, and qualitative assessments. Structures in practice seem to allow for a changing world in which projects are accepted according to business needs and subsequent actions lead accepted projects to be adapted and managed as time passes. In order to manage IT technology in this way, structures alone are important but not sufficient. Active individuals have an important role to play and credibility becomes an important factor in evaluation and implementation. The credibility of IT management is created by its selling of the project in the first place and then by its ability to manage the project in a responsive way. Credible strategists are at least as important as a strategy to the evaluation of IT.},

 abstract = {This paper is an initial investigation into types of user resistance and the management strategy expectations of users in a mandatory adoption setting. Despite its relationship to adoption, relatively little is known about user resistance. User resistance is investigated in the Enterprise System (ES) environment because the complexity and richness of ES leads users to manifest a large range of resistant behaviors and beliefs. Using Concourse Theory and Q-methodology, ES users are interviewed followed by the development of a Q-sort questionnaire, which was distributed to ES users. The results reveal eight user groups and address the management strategies preferred by each group. The results have implications for both research in the field of user resistance and adoption, and practitioners involved in system implementation.},

However, the path to large-scale electronic health record implementation is seldom smooth, involving multiple stakeholders with diverse interests and influences. This study proposes a framework that draws on both stakeholder and institutional theories to understand the complex dynamics of stakeholder interactions and institutional pressures over time during electronic health record systems implementation. This framework is utilized to analyze the national electronic health record programs of Singapore and England, which provide contrasting perspectives on how two top-down system implementations took place with different outcomes. Our results suggest that in the Singapore case, the presence of boundary spanners, supporting implementation agency that included IT staff from healthcare organizations, and greater engagement with medical professionals were associated with more positive dynamics of stakeholder interactions (e.g. limited pushback from professionals or the press) during electronic health record implementation than in England. Differences in the healthcare structures and systems, electronic health record project organization, and the combined influences of institutional pressures shed light on the varying implementation paths and outcomes in the two cases. This study adds to the health information technology literature through a comparative examination of the organizational and social processes during complex national healthcare integration projects. It also contributes to the institutional and stakeholder literatures in several ways, in particular by depicting the processes and outcomes of the dynamics of isomorphic pressures played out under different institutional conditions. Finally, our proposed framework provides a useful conceptual tool for analyzing such complex IT implementations across multiple stakeholders.},

The IT department must focus more on its customers and the services provided to support their business processes, thus enabling customers to gain competitive advantages from IT. Therefore the IT department should be treated as a separate business unit with its own characteristic services and business processes. The complexity of the IT infrastructure must be reduced by breaking it down into pieces according to the type of function its components perform. Each part must be treated as a separate unit, with services, relations and responsibilities in its own right. All this requires a major reorganization of the IT department. This paper presents the first results in the development of a practical method for organizing the IT management function and for effecting the inevitable organizational changes.},

 abstract = {Process improvement (PI) groups have been among the main change instruments of widely adopted and publicized organizational development approaches such as total quality management and business process re-engineering. Asynchronous groupware tools, such as electronic messaging systems, have found widespread use in organizations yet very little field research exists on how PI groups are affected by such tools. We try to fill this gap with a field study of the effects of asynchronous groupware support on seven PI groups in two New Zealand organizations. Our study indicates that, while not having perceived negative effects on group effectiveness, asynchronous groupware support was perceived as increasing process adoption, hierarchy suppression, departmental heterogeneity and contribution length and decreasing discussion duration, cost and interaction in PI groups. We argue that, based on these findings, the use of asynchronous groupware tools is likely to be beneficial in PI projects, particularly where a large number of PI groups proposing incremental process changes is conducted.},

 abstract = {Regulating how digital platforms use algorithms to determine and control content displayed to their users is both a controversial topic and an important societal challenge. Existing research acknowledges institutional tussles around regulating how digital platforms use algorithms to determine and control content. However, we lack research showing how the development of regulation unfolds. We build on data from a longitudinal discourse analysis of 410 media articles and 483 policy and industry documents to study two cases of algorithmic control regulation in Australia. The first involves algorithmic control for content display, the second for content moderation. We develop a process model of institutional work towards regulation of algorithmic control. It captures the institutional tussles between governments, digital platforms and third parties as each expresses their perspective on legitimate forms of algorithmic control and shapes the process and outcome of regulation. Building on our model, we discuss the dynamics of regulation development in light of the constellation of actors and their power position in the process. We further consider the regulatory outcome and highlight future research questions that build on our findings.},

@article{Komito1998a,
 abstract = {Paper documents are often described as ‘information rich’, in contrast with electronic documents. This ethnographic study examines Lotus NOTES in a sub-section of the Irish civil service, with particular reference to the concurrent use of electronic and paper documents. The sub-section examines disagreements with regard to claims by Irish citizens for particular government benefits. The study describes how meta-information contained in paper case files is perceived as necessary for the work of the organization, thus restricting the use of electronic case files in NOTES as a shared information system. However, this reliance on paper files derives not only from the information rich properties of paper documents, but also from the desire of some workers to protect their occupational status by defining, as necessary for their job, information which is only available in paper documents and which only they can interpret. This dependence on paper documents also reduces the amount of information that can be shared within the organization. This paper suggests that, only if the perceived threat posed by the information system were reduced in some way would user innovations in work practices and greater sharing of information within the organization become possible.},

 abstract = {The need to simultaneously achieve operational efficiency, while accommodating a continuous morphing of alliances and network arrangements, is a key challenge in the modern enterprise and market. Inter-firm interdependence and unpredictable market shifts heighten the need to establish an architecture and governance arrangement that permits rapid adaptation. Fully integrated firms have increasingly morphed into networks of collaborators. The demand for efficient and effective inter-firm coordination is no longer a desired condition, but essential for competitive position. Historically, the cost of this efficiency has been loss of flexibility, yet volatile markets reward efficiency and flexibility. Market trends demand an ability to improvise in the marketplace - converge execution with planning - while being simultaneously efficient. In this paper, we explore this improvisation-efficiency paradox. The architecture and governance issues are considered that seek the strengths of both effects. Efficiency need not come at a high cost in attaining the ability to be adaptive and spontaneous. We explore the key considerations of both network architecture and governance structures that characterize improvisational networks. Trade communities and trading partners establish a discipline of processes and decision rights that serve the community of collaborators.},

But where the elicitation of the characteristics of a business process usually takes place in a collaborative fashion, the building of the final, formal process model is done mostly by a single person. This article presents the design and Implementation of a Recommendation-Based Process Modeling Support System with ‘social features.’ A process builder using this system will receive recommendations to complete or edit a formal business process model on the basis of previous usage of modeling fragments by her peers. Such features potentially Improve the modeling process and, as such, the modeling outcome, that is, the quality of the process model. This article also contains an evaluation of the system's usage and effectiveness, which builds on an experimental design. It is shown that process builders are inclined to follow up on the provided recommendations and that this will improve the semantical quality of the created model. However, Information on peer usage of modeling fragments does not play a big role in selecting the recommendations being followed up. This article fits within a stream of research that puts emphasis on the modeling process, rather than on the model artifact.},

 abstract = {This case study discusses two related aspects that are becoming increasingly important in today's software development practice: re-engineering of a monolithic system into a component-based system (the focus of this case) and globally distributed work. Component-based (software) development (CBD) involves (i) the development of software components and (ii) the building of software systems through the integration of preexisting software components (developed in-house or procured from the component market). For companies involved in software development, CBD offers agility in design by basing software development on methodologies that support the recombination of reusable components, being an approach that rapidly expands product variation and sustains the build-up of product families. It also promises significant improvements in software development through shorter time-to-market and reduced development costs. However, being an innovative approach to software development that emerged in the mid-1990s, the adoption of CBD requires companies to re-engineer existing software systems (products) or to develop new systems from scratch using component technologies and to deal with additional challenges associated with the management of CBD. LeCroy Corporation was one of the early adopters of CBD that decided to adopt CBD to gain competitive advantage in its markets. The case describes an actual situation at LeCroy Corporation, involving several decisions, challenges and opportunities faced by the managers of a globally distributed software development team over a period of time when they re-engineered a monolithic system into a component-based system.},

Our starting point is that, indeed, India will remain competitive in the short-medium term. However, more importantly, we move on to argue that country attractiveness is becoming a less important issue. We consider an alternative approach to analyze country attractive in which the client's strategic intent behind going offshore and the vendor's global dispersedness and its local knowledge define the attractiveness of the firm's offshoring strategy.},

 abstract = {Component-based development (CBD) can be an appealing proposition to globally distributed software development teams because of the almost endless possibilities to recombine and reuse components in new products. In particular, it has been suggested that CBD will improve globally distributed software development practices by allowing each site to take ownership of particular components, resulting in reduced inter-site communication and coordination activities. Such an approach may indeed overcome breakdowns in inter-site coordination efforts; however, it may also lessen opportunities to share knowledge between sites and may hamper opportunities to reuse existing components. A case study approach, exploratory in nature, was adopted to explore knowledge aspects in global component-based software development. Evidence collected at several globally distributed CBD projects suggests that the true potential of CBD, which mainly relates to reusing components, can also be achieved when components are developed in a joint manner (i.e. by several sites) by accessing and utilizing expertise regardless of its geographical location. To improve the rate of component reuse, the studied teams developed capabilities in three particular areas: inter-site coordination, communications, and knowledge management. The paper concludes by discussing the links between component reuse, CBD principles and organizational capabilities, and offers managers and engineers some guidelines to consider in their CBD projects.},

We conceptualize coordination in IT support functions as a process that unfolds over time through interactions between four underlying coordination practices employed to provide reliable IT services: prioritizing tasks, following procedures, using roles and responsibilities, and utilizing networks. Furthermore, we show how these coordination practices change when IT incidents cause a shift from normal (i.e. “business-as-usual”) to emergency conditions. Our empirical research in two IT functions supporting two types of organizations (traditional and fast-response) demonstrate that IT functions in these two types of organizations respond to emergencies differently. Specifically, in emergencies, an IT function supporting a fast-response organization shifts to emergency coordination practices momentarily, as it abandons “normal” coordination practices to rely on an extensive set of formal practices specifically designed for such situations. In contrast, an IT function supporting a traditional organization is unprepared for emergencies—coordinating under emergency conditions involves improvisation, because coordination practices designed to support business-as-usual are not suitable for dealing with emergency situations.},

Based on our previous empirical studies of the practical usage of enterprise architecture artifacts in multiple organizations and broad literature analysis, this conceptual article identifies and discusses in detail 10 theories that can be considered key for understanding how an enterprise architecture practice works: actor-network theory, boundary objects theory, cognitive fit theory, communities of practice theory, decision-making theories, information processing theory, knowledge management theory, management fashion theory, media richness theory, and uncertainty principle.

Despite the Impressive scope of this phenomenon, very little Is understood about what motivates users to disclose personal Information. Integrating focus group results Into a theoretical privacy calculus framework, we develop and empirically test a Structural Equation Model of self-disclosure with 259 subjects. We find that users are primarily motivated to disclose Information because of the convenience of maintaining and developing relationships and platform enjoyment. Countervailing these benefits, privacy risks represent a critical barrier to information disclosure. However, users’ perception of risk can be mitigated by their trust in the network provider and availability of control options. Based on these findings, we offer recommendations for network providers.},

 abstract = {In this study, we examine the influence of a firm's environmental factors on its intention to adopt software as a service (SaaS). We operationalized our assessment of a firm's environmental pressures as mimetic, coercive and normative pressures and examined the moderating role of perceived technology complexity. Mimetic forces are pressures to copy or emulate other organizations’ activities, systems or structures. Coercive pressures are formal or informal pressures exerted on organizations by other organizations upon which they are dependent. Normative forces describe the effect of professional standards and the influence of professional communities on an organization. We empirically tested our research model using data from 289 valid survey responses. The results provide support for the assertion that there are both significant direct and interaction effects that influence a firm's SaaS adoption intention. Most important was the significant interaction effects between mimetic pressure and perceived technology complexity. This suggests that the complex relationships proposed by institutional theory and diffusion of innovation help to describe how environmental pressures and perceived technology complexity combine to affect intention to adopt an emerging technology. The theoretical contributions of this study are (i) we integrated, tested and validated mature theories in today's supply chain era with a new but rapidly diffusing technology, (ii) and we answered the call to include practical technology artifacts in information systems studies. From a practical perspective, through this work managers may develop a better understanding regarding environmental factors and whether or not they should consider these issues for their firm when formulating an intention to adopt SaaS.},

 abstract = {Videotex and videodisc are two relatively new media for electronic publishing. Although the current state of technology can deal with information in different forms, no one information system can handle all vocal, pictorial, textual and numerical information at the same time. The convergence of the existing technologies may provide a new environment for electronic publishing and trigger a new range of applications in this area. The Brighton videotex/videodisc project has undertaken a pilot study into a combined videotex/videodisc system in which a videodisc player is controlled by a videotex terminal so that control information on videotex pages can select still frames, or sequences of frames, on the videodisc. The system has been developed in co-operation with the English Tourist Board. It is intended to mount a public trial of the system in the near future. This paper presents a description of the combined videotex/videodisc system. The user facilities are described in detail and there is a brief discussion of the technical issues involved in the implementation.},

 abstract = {The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (EU-GDPR) has initiated a paradigm shift in data protection toward greater choice and sovereignty for individuals and more accountability for organizations. Its strict rules have inspired data protection regulations in other parts of the world. However, many organizations are facing difficulty complying with the EU-GDPR: these new types of data protection regulations cannot be addressed by an adaptation of contractual frameworks, but require a fundamental reconceptualization of how companies store and process personal data on an enterprise-wide level. In this paper, we introduce the resource-based view as a theoretical lens to explain the lengthy trajectories towards compliance and argue that these regulations require companies to build dedicated, enterprise-wide data management capabilities. Following a design science research approach, we propose a theoretically and empirically grounded capability model for the EU-GDPR that integrates the interpretation of legal texts, findings from EU-GDPR-related publications, and practical insights from focus groups with experts from 22 companies and four EU-GDPR projects. Our study advances interdisciplinary research at the intersection between IS and law: First, the proposed capability model adds to the regulatory compliance management literature by connecting abstract compliance requirements to three groups of capabilities and the resources required for their implementation, and second, it provides an enterprise-wide perspective that integrates and extends the fragmented body of research on EU-GDPR. Practitioners may use the capability model to assess their current status and set up systematic approaches toward compliance with an increasing number of data protection regulations.},

@article{LacitySolomonYanEtAl2011,
 abstract = {Organizations are increasingly sourcing their business processes through external service providers, a practice known as Business Process Outsourcing (BPO). Worldwide, the current BPO market could be as much as $279 billion and is predicted to continue growing at 25% annually. Academic researchers have been studying this market for about 15 years and have produced findings relevant to practice. The entire body of BPO research has never been reviewed, and this paper fills that gap. We filtered the total studies and reviewed 87 empirically robust BPO articles published between 1996 and 2011 in 67 journals to answer three research questions: What has the empirical academic literature found about BPO decisions and outcomes? How do BPO findings compare with Information Technology Outsourcing (ITO) empirical research? What are the gaps in knowledge to consider in future BPO research? Employing a proven method that Lacity et al. (2010) used to review the empirical ITO literature, we encapsulated this empirical literature on BPO in a way that is concise, meaningful, and helpful to researchers. We coded 43 dependent variables, 152 independent variables, and 615 relationships between independent and dependent variables. By extracting the best evidence, we developed two models of BPO: one model addresses BPO decisions and one model addresses BPO outcomes. The model of BPO decisions includes independent variables associated with motives to outsource, transaction attributes, and client firm characteristics. The model of BPO outcomes includes independent variables associated with contractual and relational governance, country characteristics, and client and supplier capabilities. Overall, BPO researchers have a broad and deep understanding of BPO. However, the field continues to evolve as clients and suppliers on every inhabited continent participate actively in the global sourcing community. There is still much research yet to be done. We propose nine future paths of research pertaining to innovation effects, retained capabilities, environmental influences, global destinations, supplier capabilities, pricing models, business analytics, emerging models, and grounded theory development.},

@article{Laffey2007,
 abstract = {June 2005 was to bring online gambling out of the shadows and into the spotlight. PartyGaming, a start-up formed in 1997, launched a flotation (Initial Public Offering) on the London Stock Exchange that valued the firm at £4.64 billion giving it a larger market capitalisation than British Airways. PartyGaming had become the dominant player in the booming online poker market with its PartyPoker brand having over 50% market share. However, this float – as with Internet gambling in general – was not without controversy. While PartyGaming had an online gambling license from the tax haven of Gibraltar, nearly 90% of its revenue came from the United States, where the authorities viewed Internet gambling as illegal and threatened legal action. The complex operations of this truly global firm with bases in London, India, Gibraltar and Canada, the background of its founder Ruth Parasol in Internet pornography and the handling of its flotation also raised concerns from an ethical perspective, with some commentators questioning whether the float should have been allowed at all. These concerns were then confirmed as US legislation to curb online gambling was passed in September 2006, leading to PartyGaming's exit from the US market and an immediate fall of 58% in the share price. This case study analyses the entrepreneurs behind PartyGaming, its growth, the challenges it has faced, the ethical issues it poses and its future prospects. The case draws on theory from e-commerce, strategy and ethics.},

In order to effectively use the resources offered by these two development environments, organizations need to answer the question: given a systems requirement, which development environment should be used to ensure success. This paper hypothesizes that the answer to this question depends upon the characteristics of the task? Drawing upon previous systems analysis and design research, we examine the effect of a task's degree of structure, interdependency, scope and periodicity, on the appropriate development environment. Results from a preliminary empirical test indicate that these task characteristics are useful in suggesting the appropriate environment for successful development of an information system.},

Questions were designed to test whether SPMs’ risky judgments were more consistent with Expected Utility Theory or Prospect Theory. Although the results were more consistent with Prospect Theory, they differed in important ways showing SPMs’ judgments to be less homogeneous than is assumed by either theory. These results highlight the potential importance of SPMs’ judgments to the outcome of software development projects.},

 abstract = {This research is driven by the assumption made in several user resistance studies that employees are generally resistant to change. It investigates the extent to which employees' resistance to IT-induced change is caused by individuals' predisposition to resist change. We develop a model of user resistance that assumes the influence of dispositional resistance to change on perceptual resistance to change, perceived ease of use, and usefulness, which in turn influence user resistance behavior. Using an empirical study of 106 HR employees forced to use a new human resources information system, the analysis reveals that 17.0–22.1 percent of the variance in perceived ease of use, usefulness, and perceptual resistance to change can be explained by the dispositional inclination to change initiatives. The four dimensions of dispositional resistance to change – routine seeking, emotional reaction, short-term focus and cognitive rigidity – have an even stronger effect than other common individual variables, such as age, gender, or working experiences. We conclude that dispositional resistance to change is an example of an individual difference that is instrumental in explaining a large proportion of the variance in beliefs about and user resistance to mandatory IS in organizations, which has implications for theory, practice, and future research.},

A study of the anticipated benefits of 178 projects as seen by IS managers and analysts revealed nine benefit factors. Business redesign emerged as the most important benefit. Some benefits are much more highly quantified than others. Organizations planned to spend more on projects whose top benefit was workforce reduction. Researchers can use these findings to study why and how organizations achieve the benefits of some proposals. Chief information officers can use them to help deliver new systems that better meet top management's expectations.},

 abstract = {A study of information systems managers and other information systems professionals at 112 different organizations confirmed that information systems software cost estimating is an important concern. Subjects reported the completion of only one of every four systems development projects within their estimates. According to them, the major cause of inaccurate estimates was changes in user requirements. Organizations using sophisticated cost estimating software packages were less successful at preventing large cost overruns than organizations not using them. However, the use of the estimator as system developer, the careful monitoring of systems development projects, and the inclusion in performance evaluations of success in meeting estimates were associated with more accurate cost estimating.},

 abstract = {Computers have made tremendous contributions towards transactional processing. However, the highest pay-off the computer can make is not in transactional processing but in decision-making. Recently, expert systems have just begun to be used in the decision-making process. Individual technologies alone are inadequate for an effective decision support. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the related issues in decision support and to develop an expert decision support system (EDSS) for combining decision support systems and expert systems into a unified whole for decision support. The emphasis will be on developing a DSS/ES model which can be used to integrate the traditional DSS database and ES knowledge-base for building a user-friendly EDSS.},

 abstract = {System integration has been the goal for both academicians and practitioners for more than two decades. Tremendous efforts have been made toward the achievement of a unifying theory or at least a framework in system integration. Unfortunately, the goal has not been achieved because of the dynamic nature of the subject. The purpose of this paper is to conduct a systematic analysis of the related subjects in system integration and to develop a framework which can be used to guide researchers and practitioners in system integration development. Traditional data modelling techniques and knowledge representation methodologies will be reviewed first. Major emphasis will be placed on object-oriented system integration and hybrid knowledge representation methods for developing an integrated intelligent decision system for next generation decision making.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a hybrid organizational structure chosen by a corporation as a means to combine the benefits of centralization and decentralization. The hybrid structure is the result of a restructuring effort by a coal company in Kentucky under the directive of its parent corporation to ensure maximum resource utilization within a more streamlined organizational structure. Through an observation of the restructuring process, we are able to demonstrate how and why it is important for top-level managers to understand and make the best use of the intricate synergism between information technology and organizational structure. The strategic implications of a hybrid structure and the roles of information technology in organizational changes are explored. We argue that a hybrid structure is a viable and strategically valuable structural alternative, especially for highly diversified conglomerates that grow through mergers and acquisitions of other companies.},

 abstract = {This paper outlines an approach to information systems planning (ISP) that addresses not just the technical problems encountered in ISP but the whole range of problems which derive from social systems, organizational processes, formal organizational arrangements, technology and the external environment. The approach is designed to improve the effectiveness of the high-level planning processes for information systems (IS). A five-phase framework is proposed. The first phase, the perception phase, aims to provide the managers with an environment that enables them to recognize the strategic value of IS and that activates them to participate in strategy formulation. The second phase, the evaluation phase, involves the evaluation of the organization's systems. The third phase, the selection phase, is focused on analysing the data collected from previous phases in order to select feasible projects. The fourth phase, the construction phase, is responsible for producing a set of preliminary IS plans. The fifth phase, the review phase, aims to ensure that ISP effectiveness is further enhanced by ongoing adjustments to the plans. The paper includes brief comments on the initial application of the framework in the Mingchi Institute of Technology.},

@article{LeeLee2000a,
 abstract = {An enterprise resource planning (ERP) application is an enterprise-wide package that tightly integrates all necessary business functions into a single system with a shared database. An ERP implementation often entails transferring the business knowledge incorporated in the basic architecture of the software package into the adopting organization. This article proposes a new approach to analysing ERP implementations from a knowledge transfer perspective. It also contributes to a better understanding of competitive advantage based on process knowledge when standardized business processes are implemented by an organization. The article begins by identifying the types of knowledge transferred during an ERP implementation and the factors affecting this transfer. It then investigates how conflicts between the business knowledge transferred from the ERP package and the existing organizational knowledge are resolved. During our investigation, we used in-depth interviews, process analysis and documentation analysis in order to analyse an early implementation stage of ERP. The results indicated that the business processes which are incorporated in an ERP package are transferred into an organization along with the business rules inherent in the processes due to process automation, the limited flexibility of such packages and the cross-functional nature of an ERP package. The results also suggested that an organization's adaptive capability concerning role and responsibility redistribution, the development of new types of required knowledge and the introduction of a different knowledge structure influence an organization's ability to internalize these standardized processes into business routines that provide a competitive advantage},

 abstract = {Information management methods are now becoming inadequate for the demand placed upon them. A process of evolutionary change, initiated during the 1980s, may not suffice because the current thinking on management theory – upon which information management is defined – is changing significantly. The salient points of this shift in the paradigm of strategic management are outlined and an indication is given of how this will impact the management of information technology. An outline of an adapted model is attempted, using a simple four-component framework: The most influence will be felt in the area of information technology planning. Systems acquisition will need to develop new, proprietary methods. The character of the day-to-day management is also significantly affected, mainly by an increased use of external agents in what will probably be new and innovative forms of alliance. The idea of an information technology keiretsu is used as an example of how such alliances could be structured.},

 abstract = {Organizational information technology (IT) needs are served through increasingly complex configurations of people, technologies, organizations, and shared information. Ideally, an organizational IT service is valuable for both the providers and users of systems and solutions. However, mutually beneficial outcomes may be difficult to achieve within the configurations through which IT services are delivered. We suggest that analyzing stakeholder interplay in IT service processes helps us to understand how information systems (IS) organizations can be leveraged to co-create business value. Through a qualitative empirical inquiry, we explore IT service realization in two case organizations. Through our analysis we find that value creation builds on orchestrated social action among the different stakeholder groups involved. Joint value creation in IT service processes hence calls for specific network leadership and resource integration capabilities from the IS organization. The paper enriches the current understanding of business value creation in IT services by infusing the service logic with traditional IT management perspectives. The findings highlight that the extent to which the IS organization can learn to facilitate the interaction between the essential actors in an ‘IT service system’ and leverage user-perceived value throughout the service process will ultimately determine its success or failure.},

@article{LiCuiWuEtAl2023,
 abstract = {As a multidisciplinary maneuver accelerated by the global pandemic, digital transformation involves changes in technological development, organizational processes, inter-organizational relationships, and business models that influence the organization’s performance and the wider environment. To better understand the inherent mechanisms of digital transformation and their positive and negative outcomes, researchers and practitioners are exploring how and when digitalization—that is, the application of digital technologies—can lead to superior sustainability performance. Based on dynamic capabilities theory, we investigate the influence of digitalization and network capability on firms’ sustainability performance, and we propose that business model innovation (BMI) plays a mediating role while environmental dynamism plays a moderating role. Both economic and environmental performance are considered subdimensions of sustainability. We examine Chinese manufacturing firms because they are under tremendous pressure to undertake digital transformation. To achieve broad generalizability, our survey-based methodology targeted 1,600 firms; we received 255 completed and validated responses. The results indicate that the effects of digitalization on novelty- and efficiency-centered BMI are mediated by network capability and that both novelty- and efficiency-centered BMI mediate the effects of digitalization and network capability on economic and environmental performance. Environmental dynamism also negatively moderates the relationship between digitalization and efficiency-centered BMI; however, it positively moderates the effect of network capability on efficiency-centered BMI. This study provides theoretical and managerial insights into organizations’ trajectories toward digital transformation and sustainable development, with special applicability to Chinese manufacturing firms.},

 abstract = {This study investigates how digital platforms can drive the digital transformation of participant firms in the surrounding business ecosystems. To do so, we conduct an in-depth case study of Alibaba’ cross-border e-commerce platform and eleven seller firms operating on the platform. Our results highlight the importance of proper empowerment in platform-driven digital transformation. In particular, we observe that Alibaba attempts to facilitate the digital transformation of seller firms through three types of activities: resource empowerment, psychological empowerment, and structural empowerment. Moreover, we find that the sequence of these empowerment activities plays a critical role. Without being psychologically empowered first, seller firms react quite passively to Alibaba’s resource provision and structural support. Psychological empowerment provides the activation triggers for the sellers to renew their mindsets and become receptive to Alibaba’s support and guidance, which ultimately contribute to the digital transformation of their businesses.},

This study systematically reviews papers on IT in China published in the ‘Senior Scholars’ Basket of Journals’ from 2000 to 2013. We have two specific objectives: to identify key research issues and trends, and to propose future directions for research on IT in China. This paper categorizes the global distribution of authors and their research methods. Five research streams are identified, including human behaviors in IS adoption and use, IS management, e-Business, social media, digital collaborations and group support, and industry and societal issues in IS. While each stream is examined in detail, we specifically pay attention to the effect of the Chinese context in each paper and the approaches to contextualizing the research. On the basis of our findings from the literature review, we propose a focus on the Chinese context as guidance for future research.},

 abstract = {In this paper we investigate an approach to eliciting practitioners’ problem-solving experience across an application domain. The approach is based on a well-known ‘pattern mining’ process which commonly results in a collection of sharable and reusable ‘design patterns’. While pattern mining has been recognised to work effectively in numerous domains, its main problem is the degree of technical proficiency that few domain practitioners are prepared to master. In our approach to pattern mining, patterns are induced indirectly from designers’ experience, as determined by analysing their past projects, the problems encountered and solutions applied in problem rectification. Through the cycles of hermeneutic revisions, the pattern mining process has been refined and ultimately its deficiencies addressed. The hermeneutic method used in the study has been clearly shown in the paper and illustrated with examples drawn from the multimedia domain. The resulting approach to experience elicitation provided opportunities for active participation of multimedia practitioners in capturing and sharing their design experience.},

 abstract = {The idea of an ecosystem suggests a holistic framing of how heterogeneous actors relate to one another and of the dynamics of their relationships. Because of the dynamics some relationships will become uncertain, posing significant challenge to the identity of participating organizations. Unfortunately, the Information Systems (IS) literature has not examined how organizations develop and negotiate their identities during ecosystem evolution. We fill this void by exploring identity challenges that Swedish Road Administration (SRA) faced while implementing the Radio Data System – Traffic Message Channel (RDS – TMC) traffic information service. Through a longitudinal case study we follow how SRA's inherited expectations, guiding norms, and standards of sense-giving about its identity prevented it from becoming a flexible service provider within an emerging mobile ecosystem. We record a constant clash – the identity tension – between the old inherited identity of a public road administrator and the aspiring new identity of a digital service provider. To enact a successful identity change, SRA had to engage in a series of change episodes whereby it deliberately implemented new routines that forged novel relationships with actors within the ecosystem. This permitted SRA to gradually align its identity to the evolving needs of the RDS-TMC service ecosystem. Our findings suggest that deliberate attempts to implement innovative mobile services – especially those involving public-private partnerships – trigger intriguing identity ambiguities and role dilemmas, and future research should therefore focus on effective strategies to identify, manage, and resolve inherent identity tensions.},

@article{LindmanMakinenKasanen2023,
 abstract = {The economic dominance of large Internet tech companies, specifically the ‘Big Five’ (Google, Apple, Meta née Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft), is fundamentally complicating the organisation of society. Their positions raise profound questions, old and new, at the intersection of information systems and political philosophy, where companies have traditionally appeared in liberal democracies as economic operators rather than powerful political actors that threaten to limit citizens’ fundamental rights significantly through their operations. Importantly, the traditional understanding of corporate social responsibility is rooted in the liberal-democratic conception of moral labour’s division between public and private powers in a market economy. Focussing on this division, the paper analyses the various types of political power these companies wield and the complexities of regulating that power. Thus, it contributes to the IS discipline’s theoretical discussion by introducing political theory concepts that hold untapped potential for reconciling Big Tech and modern liberal-democratic conceptions of society. Taking these concepts as underpinnings for discussing six types of power, in turn (business vs. politics, democratic government, institutions of a market economy, companies, civil society and citizens), the paper offers the discipline example research questions to tackle and points to potential directions for scholarship.},

 abstract = {Project sponsorship is assumed to be critical to the success of information systems development and implementation. However, there is limited research on the effect of vendor-based sponsorship on the management of information technology (IT) projects. This paper contributes to that emerging body of evidence. Drawing on literature on psychological contract, management control and project sponsorship, the authors propose that vendor-based sponsors influence project performance in two main ways. One is to protect project quality by renegotiating contract with the client; and the other is to resource the project. Based on a survey of senior managers in IT services vendor organisations, it reports that project sponsorship improves the quality, but not the cost or timeliness, of vendor delivery of IT projects. The findings suggest that IT services vendors can improve their project delivery capability by appointing project sponsors.},

 abstract = {Exploitation of the World Wide Web (WWW) is a pipedream for many businesses, as they do not or cannot analyse their motives for having a web site. Many do not understand that there is more to a successful web site than having a corporate logo on a home page. They do not foresee the effort that goes into maintaining a web site, the increased competition from exposure to a ‘global market’ via the Internet and the impact a web site will have on the existing business. This case study allows analysis of the opportunities and risks of launching electronic commerce (EC) services in the case of the Co-op Bookshop, Australia's largest academic bookseller. The case describes Co-op's difficult progression to a profitable WWW presence and investigates potential developments due to growing competition from ‘global players’ and increasing amalgamation between bookselling over the WWW and electronic publishing. The case outlines the four possibilities by which a firm can profit from its Internet activities and transfers these general benefits to Internet service provision by bookstores. In particular, it directs attention to thinking of the core goals of the business, how a WWW presence helps to meet these goals and whether the introduction of a web site changes the direction of the business. This leads to a consideration of the nature of the web site. The case study allows exploration of the current customers and markets and why the firm focuses on these. Further, there are the issues of the resources required to set up and maintain a web site, how the site may be integrated into the existing business and its growth path. These issues are explored and modelled in the teaching notes and further background detail is given.},

 abstract = {The adoption and diffusion of innovative technologies have remained critical concerns in information systems research. With the recent advent of electronic commerce, issues in system deployment and user acceptance have become even more crucial. An experimental system, Stocknet, which is a departure from normal practice in the local stock exchange which still uses conventional methods for share transactions, was developed and subjected to a pilot test through a stock trading competition using live stock data. A research framework was developed with the main emphasis on the adoption and deployment of a broad-based Internet stock-trading platform in Singapore. A logistic regression analysis was conducted to predict user acceptance of a new system from a measure of their perceptions, beliefs and attitudes and usage behaviour. The study reveals that users’ concerns, expectations, perceived ease of use and the real value added of a new system as well as their trading behaviour are critical determinants to the ultimate adoption of Internet stock trading. In fact, the probability of users accepting a new system is highly dependent on their perceptions of system evaluations and subsequently their usage behaviour. The primary focus of this paper is on users’ perspectives with a view towards a subsequent examination of policy as well as regulatory issues. Based on the results, some broad recommendations and implications are subsequently drawn with regard to the future adoption and deployment of real-time, Internet-based stock trading.},

Moreover, if these debates take place in front of colleagues from other disciplines, for example when joint schemes are being developed, then concern is often expressed about the inability of computer scientists to come to any generally accepted conclusions. In this paper the view is proposed that the key questions of computer science education are really manifestations of a much deeper issue in computing which has been alluded to in various publications, but never discussed to a generally accepted conclusion by the computer science community at large.},

 abstract = {Personality traits were examined in relation to job satisfaction and career satisfaction for 1059 information technology (IT) professionals. As hypothesized, eight traits were significantly related to both job and career satisfaction: Assertiveness, Emotional Resilience, Extraversion, Openness, Teamwork Disposition, Customer Service Orientation, Optimism, and Work Drive. Regression analyses indicated that sets of three and four traits accounted for 17 and 25%, respectively, of job and career satisfaction variance. As expected, career satisfaction correlations were of generally higher magnitude than corresponding job satisfaction correlations. Results were interpreted in terms of IT research and theorizing. The findings that Extraversion and Teamwork Disposition were related to job and career satisfaction contravenes job descriptions and career planning advice, suggesting that independent introverts are better suited for IT work. Given that adult personality is antecedent to work experiences, it was suggested that future research proposing to show the effects of work-related factors such as pay and challenge on job or career satisfaction should first control for personality traits. Other practical and theoretical implications were noted.},

 abstract = {This paper is based on data collected as part of an 11-year authors’ survey research on IT trends in different geographic regions, including North America, Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa, and Latin America. This study focuses on global similarities and differences in technology trends (e.g., management concerns, influential technologies, budgets/spending, organizational considerations) among geographies to gain insight into the challenges that IT and non-IT executives face today as well as provide an understanding of the impact these technologies have on the organization's long-term plans and investments. The results for the 11-year period show that the top five management concerns are: (i) IT-business alignment; (ii) business agility; (iii) business cost reduction/controls; (iv) business productivity; and (v) security/privacy. The five most influential technologies are: (i) analytics/business intelligence; (ii) cloud computing; (iii) ERP systems; (iv) CRM systems; and (v) security technologies. Taken together, these findings suggest that the alignment of IT and the business and leveraging IT to reduce business expenses and generate revenue are and will remain essential. The results also suggest that the role of the CIO is evolving and offshore outsourcing is on the rise. Budgets, hiring, and salaries are also increasing, albeit cautiously. This research provides important implications for IT managers to benchmark considerations such as organizational, sourcing, spending, issues/concerns, and technologies across geographies, and sheds light on a perspective on leveraging important IT trends to make thoughtful decisions about them over the coming years, and address current business challenges.},

@article{LuftmanLyytinenBenZvi2017,
 abstract = {Studies for over 30 years have consistently indicated that enterprise-level Business-Information Technology (IT) alignment is a pervasive problem. While significant progress has been made to understand alignment, research on IT alignment is still plagued by several problems. First, most alignment models approach alignment as a static relationship in contrast to analyzing the scope and variance of activities through which the alignment is (or can be) attained. Second, most alignment models are not founded on strong theoretical foundations. Third, because of their static view, these models do not guide how organizations can improve alignment. This study addresses these weaknesses using a capability-based lens. It formulates and operationalizes a formative construct rooted in the theory of dynamic capabilities and defines the scope and nature of activities that contribute to alignment. The construct identifies six dimensions promoting alignment: (1) IT-Business Communications; (2) Use of Value Analytics; (3) Approaches to Collaborative Governance; (4) Nature of the affiliation/partnership; (5) Scope of IT initiatives; and (6) Development of IT Skills. The construct measures are validated in terms of their dimensionality, item pool sampling, and the nomological and predictive validity. The research uses Partial Least Squares (PLS) to statistically validate the construct using a dataset covering over 3000 global participants including nearly 400 Fortune 1000 companies. All construct dimensions contribute significantly to the level of alignment and the construct shows strong nomological and predictive validity by demonstrating a statistically significant impact on firm performance. Scholars can leverage this research to explore additional activity-based constructs of IT-business alignment.},

 abstract = {The importance of the impact of IT for organizations around the world, especially in light of the global financial crisis, has amplified the need to provide a better understanding of the specific geographic similarities and differences of IT managerial and technical trends. Going beyond identifying these influential factors is also the need to understand the considerations for addressing them, in light of recognizing the respective local characteristics, especially when operating in a globally linked environment. By comparing and contrasting different geographies, this paper presents important local and international factors (e.g., management concerns, influential technologies, budgets/spending, organizational considerations) necessary to prepare IT leaders for the challenges that await them. The research is based on data from four geographic regions (United States, Europe, Asia, and Latin America). The same questionnaire (although translated for the respective respondents), based on the lead authors of the well-respected and long-running Society for Information Management survey, was applied across geographies. This paper presents the major findings based on survey responses from 472 organizations (172 US, 142 European, 103 Asian, and 55 Latin) in mid-2010. The top five management concerns were: (1) business productivity and cost reduction; (2) IT and business alignment; (3) business agility and speed to market; (4) business process re-engineering; and (5) IT reliability and efficiency. The five most influential technologies were business intelligence, cloud computing, enterprise resource planning, Software as a Service/Platform as a Service, and collaborative tools.},

@article{LundellLings2004,
 abstract = {Tool support for information systems (IS) development can be considered from many perspectives, and it is not surprising that different stakeholders perceive such tools very differently. This can contribute on one side to poor selection processes and ineffective deployment of CASE, and on another to inappropriate tool development. In this paper, the relationship between CASE-tools and IS development methods is considered from three stakeholder perspectives: concept developer, IS developer and product developer. These perspectives, and the tensions between them, are characterised within a ‘stakeholder triangle’. Some of the major issues related to each tension are highlighted, and the triangle is then used to consider the importance, and implications for all stakeholders, of considering all tensions together. In particular, we suggest that the concept of ‘method in action’ be complemented by that of ‘method in tool’. We believe that these insights will contribute to the continuing debate on how to reduce adoption failures.},

 abstract = {In this article, we analyze institutionalization as a process of transferring and stabilizing material artifacts and routines in the form of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. Although past studies have analyzed institutionalization as structuring around scripts or discourse moves, we emphasize the material role of artifacts and routines as carriers of institutional logics. In addition, insitutionalization is not linear and incremental, but goes through sudden, nonlinear disruptions. To this end, we apply punctuated socio-technical information system change (PSIC) model that draws upon Gersick's model of change to identify and trace moves that are critical during the institutionalization. The model accounts for ERP institutionalization by chronicling complex interactions between socio-technical elements in the implementation system, the work system, and organizational and environmental context which together account for the institutionalization outcome. We use the model to analyze a longitudinal case covering 11 years (1993–2004) of ERP implementation processes in a large Saudi steel firm. Our analysis shows that the proposed material and punctuated lens toward institutionalization offers rich insights how and why ERP systems become institutions and why their institutionalization is difficult and unfolds in unpredictable ways. We conclude that the normally held assumptions of successful linear and incremental adaptation to new institutional patterns logics out by ERP systems do not hold.},

 abstract = {Administrative reform currently being undertaken in a number of developing countries is focusing on the introduction of microcomputers as a tool for the decentralization of rural development administration. Experience to date concerning these efforts reveals that the key determinants of successful implementation of the technology are associated with organizational factors rather than hardware and software. However, these factors have been inadequately addressed in the literature on information technology in developing countries and empirical research drawing on experience of individual projects in developing countries is needed. To this end, this paper describes the case of the Computerized Rural Information Systems Project (CRISP) which is a government initiative to promote decentralization of rural development management in India. The interaction between formal, government-approved guidelines for rural development management and informal practice at the local level is examined. The findings reveal that the diffusion of technology has not been accompanied with changes to local work, decision and administrative processes.},

 abstract = {The tendency of acquiring information systems and other high technology services from international suppliers continues at unprecedented levels. The primary motivation for the offshore sourcing of technology and services continues to be labor cost arbitrage, and secondly, access to higher levels of expertise. Yet paradoxically, large gaps in technical proficiency, cultural values, and communication styles between client and vendor can undermine the overall success of the offshore relationship. This paper argues that a new breed of entities have emerged, brokering or intermediating offshore relations. The capabilities of such ‘middlemen’ include moderating disparities in expertise, culture, and communication styles that often deteriorate performance in offshore relationships. The paper presents a preliminary theoretical justification for the emergence of offshore intermediaries, describes how and why they develop boundary spanning capabilities, and offers a case study as initial evidence substantiating the function and processes in intermediating transnational offshoring relationships. Our theory development concludes with propositions concerning four major offshore intermediary capabilities: (i) intermediating cultural distance, (ii) intermediating cognitive distance, (iii) pre-contractual preparation and negotiation, and (iv) post-contractual operational management.},

 abstract = {Network effects and switching costs are two major economic forces in information technology industries. Although the consequences of these mechanisms on competition and firm strategy have been well documented in the literature, research on their impact on customer behavior has received less attention. In this study, the authors investigate the role of personal network effects and switching costs in explaining customer choice in the Spanish mobile telecommunications industry. Personal network effects are present when an individual user's utility increases more when some individuals adopt (social network) than when others do. Switching costs refer to costs associated with the process of switching from one provider to another. In addition, this paper studies the drivers of personal network effects and switching behavior. The results reveal that personal network effects and switching costs play a key role in determining mobile users’ choice: the probability that a customer selects a mobile phone company increases with the number of members of her social network already subscribed to that firm, and switching costs are significantly present in the mobile phone market making switching providers costly. Concerning the drivers of both mechanisms, the authors find that relationship characteristics (length, depth and breadth) and demographics differently affect personal network effects perceptions and consumer switching behavior. Implications for decision makers are discussed.},

@article{MaMcGroarty2017,
 abstract = {In recent years, financial markets have been fundamentally transformed by innovations in information technology, in particular with regard to the web, social networks, high-speed computer networks and mobile technologies. We borrow the concept of Social Machines from Web Science as a single concept that captures the essence of all these recent technological changes to argue that the emergence of these Social Machines has aided the transformation of financial markets and society. This study explores the formation of these Social Machines with three sample disruptive technologies – automated/high-frequency trading, social network analytics and smart mobile technology. Through critical reflective analysis of these three case studies, we assess the impact of information technology innovation on financialisation. We adopt three case studies – automated trading; market information extraction using social media technologies; and information diffusion and trader decision-making with mobile technology on financial and real sector changes – which demonstrate the increasing trend of transaction velocity, speculative trading, increased complex information network, accelerated inequality and leverage. Our findings demonstrate that technologically enabled financial Social Machines harness crowd wisdom, engage disparate individual traders to produce more accurate price estimations, and have enhanced decision-making capability. However, these same changes can also have a simultaneously detrimental effect on financial and real sectors, in some situations exacerbating underlying distortions, such as misinformation due to complex information networks, speculative trading behaviour, and higher volatility with transaction velocity. Overall, we conclude that these innovations have transformed the fundamental nature of key aspects of the finance industry and society as a whole.},

@article{MarchildonHadaya2023,
 abstract = {Despite all our theorizing efforts and the importance that we and our major information systems (IS) journals ascribe to theory development, making theoretical contributions to our field remains challenging. Recognizing that we cannot develop better theories without improving how we theorize, our field is now engaged in an in-depth discussion of the theorizing process. This manuscript contributes to this discussion by exposing why and how leveraging paradigms when theorizing can foster theoretical contributions within our field. Its premise is that we need to stop working within the confines of a limited set of well-entrenched paradigms and move beyond what is known as true and correct to come up with improvements that significantly alter the way we come to rationalize, explain, and master our world. Anchored on this premise, this manuscript begins by discussing the origin, role, and features of paradigms as well as explaining that they are of three different but interrelated forms (i.e., metaphysical, sociological, and artefactual). The manuscript then adds to this understanding of paradigms by detailing the unique relationships that tie paradigms of each form to theory and explaining why taking advantage of these unique bonds when theorizing may help us make theoretical contributions. Lastly, to foster theoretical contributions within our field, this manuscript proposes a set of guidelines to help us leverage paradigms of the different forms when theorizing.},

 abstract = {The use of electronic mail and the non-use of an accounting information system (IS) by a group of executives at a major telecommunications company provided the opportunity of exploring the reasons why executives use information technology (IT). The paper draws on qualitative and quantitative research data to give a holistic and integrative explanation. This is based on the perceptions of executives and is interpreted through a wide range of prior research which incorporates media richness theory, social interaction theories and technology acceptance modelling. The case study draws particular attention to the concept of media style. Structuration theory is used to draw together the several factors which are to be found in the existing literature and in the case study. Individual action and structure interacted to create the changing conditions which typify the context for executive use of IT at the case study site. The structure comprises IT itself, task and social and technological factors.},

 abstract = {This paper responds to the findings of the research by Currie and Guah on the introduction of the National Programme for Information Technology through an institutional theory perspective. It considers both the appropriateness and applicability of the method chosen in the light of what is already known about UK healthcare organisations and the complex and changing process that is involved in both the organisation and any research that takes place. This is further confounded by an unstable political environment both nationally and locally and a failure to understand the changing location, role and status of the medical record. Only when this is resolved will a transformational change occur, in line with the new patient-focused government agenda and the external world of technology that must engage with the emotional as well as the rational role that both technology and health play in people's lives.},

@article{Markus2004,
 abstract = {Using IT in ways that can trigger major organizational changes creates high-risk, potentially high-reward, situations that I call technochange (for technology-driven organizational change). Technochange differs from typical IT projects and from typical organizational change programs and therefore requires a different approach. One major risk in technochange—that people will not use information technology and related work practices—is not thoroughly addressed by the discipline of IT project management, which focuses on project cost, project schedule, and solution functionality. Organizational change management approaches are also generally not effective on their own, because they take as a given the IT “solutions” developed by a technical team. Consequently, the potential for the IT “solution” to be misaligned with important organizational characteristics, such as culture or incentives, is great. Merely combining IT project management and organizational change management approaches does not produce the best results, for two reasons. First, the additive approach does not effectively address the many failure-threatening problems that can arise over the lengthy sequential process of the typical technochange lifecycle. Second, the additive approach is not structured to produce the characteristics of a good technochange solution: a complete intervention consisting of IT and complementary organizational changes, an implementable solution with minimal misfits with the existing organization, and an organization primed to appropriate the potential benefits of the technochange solution. With hard work and care, the combined IT project management plus organizational change approach can be made to work. However, an iterative, incremental approach to implementing technochange can be a better strategy in many situations. The essential characteristic of the technochange prototyping approach is that each phase involves both new IT functionality and related organizational changes, such as redesigned business processes, new performance metrics, and training.},

 abstract = {Enterprise resource planning (ERP) packages touch many aspects of a company's internal and external operations. Consequently, successful deployment and use of ERP systems are critical to organizational performance and survival. This paper presents the results of a study of the problems and outcomes in ERP projects which was conducted under the sponsorship of an ERP systems vendor. Two basic research questions were addressed. First, how successful are companies at different points in time in their ERP experiences and how are different measures of success related? (That is, can early success be followed by failure and vice versa?) Second, what problems do ERP adopters encounter as they implement and deploy ERP and how are these problems related to outcomes? The findings showed that the success of ERP systems depends on when it is measured and that success at one point in time may only be loosely related to success at another point in time. Companies experience problems at all phases of the ERP system life cycle and many of the problems experienced in later phases originated earlier but remained unnoticed or uncorrected. These findings suggest that researchers and companies will do well to adopt broad definitions and multiple measures of success and pay particular attention to the early identification and correction of problems.},

 abstract = {This study examines the involvement and attitudes of internal auditors to the prevention and detection of computer fraud. This approach differs from previous research which has concentrated on learning from frauds which have occurred. The main enquiry was by means of a questionnaire sent to members of the Institute of Internal Auditors. Verification and additional information was forthcoming by visiting some respondents. Almost a fifth of internal audit departments reported that they had no specific responsibility for either prevention or detection of computer fraud. It was clear that where responsibility was acknowledged, it is generally on an informal basis or is self imposed. Internal auditors reported that most reliance was placed on computer assisted tools and manual techniques like input/output reconciliation for detection of computer fraud. Few of the organisations surveyed had any laid down guidelines what to do in the case of a fraud discovery. Where guidelines did exist they called for dismissal and prosecution. In smaller firms, external auditors have a larger role in the prevention and detection of computer fraud than in larger firms. Opinion on the prevention and detection of computer fraud included the view that as network systems become more common, so detection and prevention will become more difficult. In addition it was claimed that management did not appreciate the level of the threat. Internal auditors feel that they have a role to play, but highlighted the fact that there is a shortage of staff with the requisite skills.},

 abstract = {The development of high quality technical systems is an ongoing important element of information systems success. This paper investigates the current practice of information technology project configuration from a management viewpoint. It is based on a series of semi-structured interviews across a range of medium to large organizations in the UK, including both users and providers of IT services. It finds that project requirements, strategic IT policies, risk management, pragmatic considerations, the managed exploitation of experience and the managed adoption of new technologies drive individual project configuration. The paper proposes a new integrated model that explicitly identifies the drivers of project configuration management. It illustrates the model using a published case study and generates directions for further research and implications for practitioners.},

 abstract = {Large software organizations establish software technology units for managing the methods and tools aimed at supporting their software engineers. This division between software development and new technologies for software development establishes specialized competencies, supports standardization across software projects and departments and provides dedicated resources for innovation. However, such software technology units are faced with complex diffusion projects that are difficult and challenging to manage and that in many cases lead to unsatisfactory results. This paper reports from attempts to improve diffusion practices within a technology unit in a large software organization. Two complementary roles for software technology units, i.e. technology supplier and service provider, are presented and used for interpreting the experiences. The research suggests that technology units in large software organizations can improve their diffusion practices by complementing the traditional role as a technology supplier with that of a service provider. The paper offers lessons on how software organizations can take steps in that direction.},

 abstract = {Although sociomaterial theorizing has provided important insights into how digital technologies enable or constrain behavior in organizational contexts, there is a need to advance theory to better account for how digital technologies shape heterogeneous work practices in which distributed organizational actors use diverse technology portfolios to collaboratively produce and consume information. Against that backdrop, we draw on the distinction between digital mediation and digital representation to investigate tensions in how actors transfer information across organizational and technological boundaries, how they translate information into meaning, and how they eventually transform information into action in digitalized work. We illustrate and develop this framing through detailed analyses of digitally-enabled, condition-based maintenance of equipment in a mining context. Drawing on these analyses and extant literature, we advance theory on tensions in how digital technologies are implicated in producing and consuming information in today’s increasingly heterogeneous work practices.},

@article{MathiassenSoreness2008,
 abstract = {The use of information technology (IT) in organizations has undergone dramatic changes during the past 30 years. As a result, it has become increasingly common to adopt services rather than traditional systems perspective to more accurately capture contemporary practices. There is, however, a lack of theories that can help us understand, assess, and design information services in organizational contexts. On this backdrop, we combine general notions of information processing options and requirements to outline a contingency theory of organizational use of information services. The theory suggests that information services are configurations of heterogeneous information processing capabilities; these services are evoked by organizational actors to help execute tasks, and evoking different configurations may lead to equally satisfactory outcomes. The theory distinguishes between four types of services computational, adaptive, networking, and collaborative services, and it suggests that organizational actors need portfolios of information services that are suited to the equivocality and uncertainty profile of the information processing they face. The paper defines four types of services and how they relate to information processing requirements; it applies the theory to a study of information services in response to vehicle policing; and it outlines how the theory relates to standardization and unintended consequences of information services. We conclude by discussing the theory and its implications for research and practice.},

 abstract = {Low-code platforms can provide a learning environment that integrates academic theory with practical experiences, allowing students to experience real-world ISD projects. Such a pedagogy is known as work-integrated learning (WIL). In a low-code WIL course, the focus is on the practical development experiences and the delivery of a business application based on client’s requirements. Yet, the real-world ISD experiences may inhibit metacognition, which is essential for students to succeed in future learning of digital innovations. Without metacognition, students struggle to learn how to learn and be reflective about their learning. This study uses a mixed-method design and draws on Flavell’s (1979) theoretical framework to examine metacognition in the context of low-code WIL. In particular, the study examines the effect of learner-oriented factors and task-oriented factors on metacognition and its impact on learning outcomes, such as knowledge confidence, app delivery, and grade. The quantitative results indicate that metacognition is influenced by motivation, the strategic approach, and autonomy, whereas self-efficacy beliefs have no effect. The learning outcomes are also achieved. Qualitative results (students’ essays and apps) corroborate the quantitative results while also providing additional insights into the learning in low-code WIL showing the impact of the platform and agile ISD practices on metacognition. Overall, this study offers IS educators a better understanding of how low-code platforms can foster learning-to-learn while providing real-world practical experiences.},

@article{McAulayDohertyKeval2002,
 abstract = {This study used an earlier critique of the cultural sciences for exploring the ideological basis for the evaluation of outsourcing. Questionnaire and interview responses are presented. These incorporate a range of evaluative criteria, which together represent an indicative list of the benefits and risks of outsourcing. The paper initially suggests that different stakeholders might be impacted on in different ways by benefits and risks. It is suggested that information technology outsourcing evaluation might thus be partial and not neutral in its impact on stakeholders. However, the differences and similarities between stakeholders suggest a subtle interplay of ideological concerns that does not totally deny the interests of all but the dominant stakeholders. Although the evaluation may be partial this does not deny the potential for those who might be presumed to be disadvantaged for making personal gains. However, in making personal gains, an ideology based on economic interests is furthered, thus occluding the opportunity for autonomous and responsible engagement with the process of evaluation.},

 abstract = {Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) is a young research field, no more than ten years old, concerned with the development and use of computer systems to support cooperative working. Although researchers and practitioners in this area have many interests in common, there is a great deal of diversity in definitions of and approaches to CSCW. This diversity has arisen despite the clarity of intention of the early seminal papers that attempted to set the agenda for CSCW research. Ten years into the development of this research area, a number of tensions appear to be diluting this initial clarity. These tensions reveal themselves in apparent disjunctions between theoretical papers and statements of intent on the one hand and CSCW practice (research and design) on the other. In this paper a review of the state-of-the-art of CSCW is offered. Some existing systems, and related design and evaluation research, are described. Then three sources of the aforementioned tension are explored: the role of technology in driving or being derived from the science; conceptions of working and cooperative working in particular; and the relationship between CSCW and organization.},

@article{McKayMarshallHirschheim2012,
 abstract = {This paper arose from concerns regarding the current conceptualizations of ‘design’ in the emerging literature on design science (DS) in information systems (IS). In this paper, we argue that current conceptualizations of design in IS are overly narrow, which necessarily limits what is viewed as acceptable DS research. In response we advance a more encompassing view of design. The revised view extends the current perspectives of design in the IS literature to embrace broader conceptualizations of design, which are evident in many intellectual communities outside IS where design is viewed as a critical component of both research and practice - such as management, engineering, architecture and others. In addition to the fairly common conceptualizations of design as product and design as process or action, design is also conceived as: intention; planning - including modeling and representation; communication; user experience; value; professional practice; and as service. Further, whereas the current conceptualization of design in IS views IS design knowledge as split across two paradigms, namely DS and behavioral science, in this paper we argue for a broader and more integrated view of design: one that emphasizes both the construction-centered and human-centered aspects of design in IS. Building from our broader view, we discuss some of the implications for design-oriented research in IS, and consider ways in which this human- centered perspective might impact on the context and content of design research in IS.},

As evidenced by widespread litigation, investors and creditors believe that this performance needs to be improved. This paper reports on research which analysed financial data for 60 public companies via an inductive inferencing algorithm. The end result was a simple and theoretically consistent model that was 97% accurate in predicting bankruptcy. Auditors, investors and creditors may find the model useful in improving their bankruptcy prediction capability.},

@article{MclellanMarcolinBeamish1995a,
 abstract = {Information Systems (IS) functions and whole IS departments are being outsourced in industries where the IS functions have been considered ‘core’ to the success of that business. Why and how senior management came to make these decisions is the focus of this article. It explains the motivations behind Information Technology (IT) outsourcing when popular alliance theories, such as transaction cost theories, game theory and joint-venture alliance theory suggested firms would not outsource an entity if core competency would be lost. Seven case studies were used to investigate the IT outsourcing phenomenon in the observed ‘alliance-like’ relationships emerging in the banking industry in the early 1990s. Inductive theory generating research was undertaken in this work following Yin's (1984, 1989) guidelines of multiple case replications to ensure rigorous and systematic data collection procedures. Before the case studies were conducted, 40 preliminary interviews were undertaken with managers of companies that were and were not involved in IT outsourcing contracts to explore the theorized factors of interest drawn from the literature, to develop the propositions, and to refine a structured interview guide. These preparatory steps led into the initial case study, and the literal replications of the proposed factors to confirm the patterns found. A theoretical replication based on conflict resolution was then undertaken to expose greater variation in conflict with the outsourcing relationships to contrast the initial patterns found. The results suggest that financial motivations underlie many IT outsourcing decisions, and unresponsive IS departments are accelerating the pace of the outsourcing process. Within this research, IT outsourcing was found to have profound effects on the expenses for the banks. However, contrary to conventional wisdom, IT outsourcing is taking place within firms and industries which utilize IS activities that are considered core competencies. Several strategic motivations were presented that may explain this management decision. Firms were undertaking IT outsourcing to change the organizational boundaries, to restructure, to mitigate technological risk and uncertainty, to access emerging technology, to manage the IS department better, and to link business and IT strategy.},

However, the range of interorganizational activities also includes less structured interactions, such as negotiations and joint problem solving. This paper wants to contribute to a better understanding of the potential of IOS by developing the notion of a high-level IOS. Technological and managerial challenges are delineated that have to be mastered in order to reach high-level IOS. Underlying the analysis of these challenges is the prediction of an evolution of IOS that is based on the analysis of the evolution of internal information systems (IS).},

 abstract = {Organizational productivity can be maximized by creating, using and maintaining structural and dynamic configurations of multi-participant interaction. The paper highlights a number of areas for consideration that arise when studying coordination within an organizational setting. The focus of the analysis is on two types of tasks: decision-making tasks and routine office processes. The paper argues that a number of (conflicting) options exist when developing the coordination aspects of group systems; they are classified across the following axes: specification and implementation of coordination; use of synchronous and asynchronous working phases; information exchange and information sharing; support of sequential and concurrent processing; support of negotiation and conflict resolution; support of analytical modelling; and description of the organizational environment.},

New customer value propositions have to be established in most markets and new marketing strategies must be formulated. One of the business sectors most heavily affected is banking. How can banks retain loyal customers when moving into electronic banking? Research in marketing has unveiled several determinants of customer loyalty. However, this knowledge is based on research on customers in traditional markets. In this paper we focus on customers’ loyalty in on-line banking. The findings indicate that determinants of loyalty in on-line banking environments are similar to those in the physical market-place. However, customer satisfaction is found to have the most significant impact, followed by brand reputation, while switching costs and search costs, although significant, have minor explanatory power. The implications of these findings on banks’ marketing strategies are discussed.},

 abstract = {Because of COVID-19 lockdowns, managers and administrators have begun to look for new ways to monitor and control their stranded-at-home workforce. Yet long before the pandemic already, advancements in datification, sensorization, and artificial intelligence have given rise to what we call connected workplace surveillance. At the heart of this new mode of employee monitoring and control is the extension of the scope of data collection beyond what is necessary and reasonable for performance appraisals or managerial oversight. This includes treating an employee’s body as a data source, disrespecting the boundaries between business and private life, or using gathered surveillance information for subtle persuasion, manipulation, and coercion. This article provides a new perspective on control theory, examining the characteristics of connected surveillance and comparing it to visual or computerized surveillance. Taking an employee-centric position, it also proposes a research agenda for critical, behavioral, and design-oriented scholars who wish to explore the identified issues.},

 abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic has increased the pressure on organizations to ensure health and safety in the workplace. An increasing number of organizations are considering wearables and physiolytics devices as part of their safe return to work programs so as to comply with governments’ accountability rules. As with other technologies with ambivalent use (i.e., simultaneously beneficial and harmful), the introduction of these devices in work settings is met with skepticism. In this context, nudging strategies as a way of using design, information, and other ways to manipulate behaviors (system 1 nudge) and choices (system 2 nudge) has gained traction and is often applied alongside the introduction of ambivalent technologies with the aim to “nudge” their use. While the feasibility of different nudge strategies is often studied from only a managerial perspective, where employees’ volitional autonomy and dignity is often treated as secondary, we explore which nudges are acceptable from the perspectives of ordinary workers. Using Q-methodology as a more evolutionary and participatory way to design nudges, we describe five basic strategies that are (to varying degrees) acceptable to them: (a) positive reinforcement and fun, (b) controlling the organizational environment, (c) self-responsibility, (d) collective responsibility, and (e) adapting the individual environment. Our findings show that there is a wide range of viewpoints on what is being considered an acceptable nudge and stress the importance of a transparent, equal dialogue between those who design nudges and potential nudgees.},

 abstract = {The impact of a particular computer language on the process of developing an information system is not well understood. This paper explores the issues through interviews with 16 software developers who changed, or considered changing, from a third to a fourth generation computer language. The conclusion is that there can be considerable costs in hardware, inflexibility and project planning errors incurred by changing to a fourth generation language. The benefits are unlikely to compensate for the costs of changing languages. The key factors influencing the productivity of software developers emerged as social, not technical.},

 abstract = {This paper explores user and provider experiences with broadband networks. Drawing on data from an early broadband trial and from recent studies of consumer broadband usage, the validity of the commonly held view that widespread adoption of broadband is dependent upon the development of a killer application is challenged. It is argued that access to broadband can be valuable for users without the provision of a killer application and that the dynamics of broadband development are shifting. As more users become content creators and distributors and as it becomes easier for consumers to establish broadband networks without help from traditional providers, the existing relationships within the broadband industry will change. Broadband researchers and stakeholders in the development of broadband networks are encouraged to explore and understand the implications of these changes, recognizing that there is much to be learned about deploying broadband in ways that will create the broad societal benefits promised by its promoters.},

 abstract = {In recent years, a number of studies have adopted institutional theory as a perspective for examining Information Systems (IS)/Information Technology (IT)-related phenomena such as IT innovation, IS development and implementation, and IT adoption and use. The objective of this paper is to take stock of how institutional theory is being used in IS research. To this end, it first proposes a conceptual framework to encapsulate the main concepts of institutional theory. Second, it synthesizes the findings of 53 articles that adopted an institutional perspective to study IS/IT phenomena. Finally, it identifies conceptual and methodological issues that researchers need to address when adopting an institutional perspective.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a personal overview of the history of the IS discipline over the last 20 years. It highlights two particular strands of development over which there has been much controversy - the so-called paradigm wars which were an epistemological battle between positivism and interpretivism; and the related debate over a critical approach to information systems. It is argued that the battle has died down and a period of stability has emerged. But further development needs to occur, especially in the area of critical management, and the philosophy of critical realism can be a significant way forward.},

 abstract = {It is first argued that the commercial failure of knowledge-based systems (KBS) is due to the lack of business emphasis of KBS development methodologies. This article outlines the evolution of KBS methodologies and the recent change of emphasis from a technology-driven to a business-led approach. It further examines the ‘application identification and selection’ activities of two KBS methodologies, KADS and STAGES. Their weaknesses are highlighted and it is argued that an integrated strategic methodological approach to the development of information systems and knowledge-based systems is required. The strategic phase of an IS methodology is then summarized; specific points within it where KBS-related activities could be incorporated are identified. This exercise illustrates how IS methodologies could be used as a basis for the joint strategic planning of IS and KBS systems.},

 abstract = {Historical perspectives are only timidly entering the world of IS research compared to historical research in management or organisation studies. If major IS outlets have already published history-oriented papers, the number of historical papers - although increasing - remains low. We carried out a thematic analysis of all papers on History and IS published between 1972 and 2009 indexed on ABI and papers indexed in Google Scholar ™ for the same period. We used a typology developed by theorists Üsdiken and Kieser, who classify historical organisation research into supplementarist, integrationist and reorientationist approaches. We outline their links with the epistemological stances well known in IS research, positivism, interpretivism and critical research; we then focus on their differences and historiographical characteristics. We found that most IS History papers are supplementarist descriptive case studies with limited uses of History. This paper then suggests that IS research could benefit from adopting integrationist and reorientationist historical perspectives and we offer some examples to illustrate how that would contribute to enriching, extending and challenging existing theories.},

 abstract = {This article empirically investigates the process by which a digital infrastructure evolved and took the architectural form of a digital platform as a core–periphery structure over a 20-year period. Our study pays special attention to the developmental dependencies of the components of the infrastructure’s installed base and how the interdependencies between the platform core and periphery evolve over time. We use the notion of ‘generative entrenchment’ to provide an account of the formation and unfolding of a core–periphery structure from an evolving digital infrastructure that highlights three aspects of the process. First, the process of architectural evolution that our study depicts comprises three phases showing a gradual reversal of the entrenchment relationship of the platform core and periphery: (1) entrenchment of the periphery, (2) mutual entrenchment of the core and periphery, and (3) entrenchment of the core. Second, we show how the generatively entrenched infrastructure’s installed base shaped the decisions and choices regarding the initial platform core. Third, we identify three architectural practices (creating redundancy in the core, augmenting the core with novelty, and reducing the heterogeneity of an entrenched peripheral component and later integrating it into the core) that weakened the entrenchment of the peripheral components, amplified the role of the core, and consolidated the core–periphery structure.},

 abstract = {Knowledge acquisition is a major task in expert system development. This paper proposes one way of acquiring knowledge for expert system development: through the use of the Internet. Internet resources (e.g. Usenet groups, ListServ discussion lists, archive sites and on-line literature/database searches) are knowledge sources. Internet tools such as newsreaders, electronic mail, Telnet, FTP, gophers, archie, WAIS and World Wide Web provide access to these sources. The results of an exploratory study that examined the use of the Internet as a knowledge source are presented here in conjunction with a framework for using the Internet in the planning phase. Four major advantages can be found in this: the availability of multiple experts in multiple domains, the interaction of domain experts and end users, time/cost savings, and convenience. The lessons learned and some additional issues are also presented.},

 abstract = {This paper develops a new framework for analysing how and why IT is being applied to the infrastructure of the‘information economy’. The interaction of micro and macro aspects of IT provides an economic rationale for the IT community to go beyond questions of firms’ operations and strategies and to look towards national and international economic change. The micro-economic roles of transactions, communication and information infrastructure are analysed. These are then considered in terms of IT-related policy, from the local to the international level, illustrated by property rights legislation and changes in the European economic environment. It is concluded that the significance of IT lies primarily in its role as the very means by which markets and other economic mechanisms operate.},

 abstract = {This paper draws on work undertaken for the Butler Cox Productivity Enhancement Programme (PEP) to describe a process model which will provide a basis for overcoming the problems of cost and complexity associated with software maintenance. PEP is a continuous program that is open to organizations wishing to measure and improve systems development and productivity. The paper argues that for maintenance work to be effective, it is vital to control the input to the process — the procedure by which change requests are notified and managed in the first place. The procedure of change management is followed by impact analysis, system release planning, change design, implementation, testing and system release/integration. These steps, which occur sequentially, are supported by a further activity that continues concurrently - progress monitoring. The conclusion of the paper is that a coordinated program, effective across the whole maintenance process and designed to control changes to the system, will become more and more critical as the complexity of the system increases. Formal procedures are essential to ensure that software is not degraded and to provide an audit facility. At the same time there are several automated change and control packages now available that could help to reduce administrative overheads and increase control over system changes.},

 abstract = {The paper argues that the current generation of re-engineering tools can provide significant benefits for those organizations which have high applications maintenance overheads. The paper classifies the different types of re-engineering tools and their application potential. It is argued that these tools promise to provide a migration path towards the integrated computer-aided software environments which will emerge over the next 5–10 years. This paper follows on from work which the author has undertaken for the CSC-Index Performance Enhancement Programme (PEP). PEP is a continuous programme that is open to organizations wishing to measure and improve systems development and productivity.},

It is shown that the personal constructs elicited reflect most of the contingency variables and risk-drivers mentioned in the information systems development literature, but also include some situational characteristics not addressed in this literature. It is concluded that personal construct elicitation techniques have a valuable role to play in information systems development research.},

@article{MuhlburgerKrumay2023,
 abstract = {Digital transformation is a phenomenon perceived across a multitude of contexts in the organizational societal and individual domains. Conceptualizing this broad phenomenon requires an approach that provides structure and comparability across contexts and domains whilst containing sufficient contextual detail and specificity to avoid conceptual stretching. Utilizing a multi-method approach this paper draws from a set of empirical data to develop such a context-sensitive conceptualization for digital transformation. Utilizing a design perspective on digital transformation this paper (1) develops a conceptual meta-structure capable of representing instances of digital transformation independent of domain and context and (2) develops a taxonomy of context-specific categories for the identified meta-elements. The three elements Representation, Technology, and Effect (RTE) constitute the meta-structure, the taxonomy is comprised of seven representation, ten technology and nine effect categories. We evaluated our results utilizing a card sorting approach in a workshop setting. The proposed conceptualization is capable to accommodate context-specific manifestations of digital transformation in all tested environments thereby indicating its applicability as a foundation for a context-sensitive conceptualization of digital transformation. The paper contributes to the evolving body of literature on digital transformation by providing a conceptual meta-structure capable of capturing manifestations of digital transformation in a uniform and structured manner across domains and contexts.},

Although ESSs have been shown to enhance the decision-making capabilities of individuals, their benefits in supporting group decision making are less clear. To the best of our knowledge, no empirical research has evaluated the effectiveness of the technology in the group setting or compared its usefulness for supporting individual versus group decision making. The results of this research show that ESSs benefit decision making of both individuals and groups and novices are able to gain more from ESSs than experts. The findings also suggest that groups outperform individuals in both with and without ESS support settings.},

@article{Nakayama2000a,
 abstract = {Electronic commerce is transforming interorganizational relationships in marketing channels. Reports frequently note that ‘power’ goes to those who gain relevant trading information in marketing channels. The paper then asks whether and how structured or ‘automated’ trading information exchanges (e.g. electronic data interchange (EDI) links) between suppliers and wholesalers impact on their bargaining power in grocery marketing channels. This paper starts with the view that automated information exchanges favour the suppliers because they obtain trading information and gain marketing flexibility more than the wholesalers do. Focusing on the perspective of grocery wholesalers, the paper examines the relationships between (1) EDI use, (2) suppliers’ incentives for EDI, (3) wholesalers’ perceived bargaining power and (4) trust and cooperation between wholesalers and suppliers. Based on exploratory survey data from 33 grocery wholesalers, the paper finds that automated information exchanges may lower wholesalers’ perceived bargaining power. It also shows that an appropriate level of incentives from suppliers tends to compensate for the power loss. This results in higher trust and cooperation in their trading relationships.},

 abstract = {Despite the widespread adoption of Executive Information Systems (EIS) and their increasing importance in organizations, the process of their development is not well understood. The mainstream EIS literature tends to report success stories of EIS in the organizations studied and attribute this to a pre-planned rational process of origin and design of EIS. In this paper, a case study of the EIS development process in a manufacturing company is used to critique this rational view and to illustrate the applicability of an alternative perspective based on an organizational behavioural model. This paper suggests that greater recognition of the social nature of the process of IS development is necessary to understand how systems projects may be better managed.},

Recently, changes in the nature of technologies used in organizational contexts and changing organizational structures call for a renewed focus on IT championing to explain its distributed nature. Following an analytic induction approach and drawing from semi-structured interviews with 37 practitioners (physicians, residents, nurses, IT staff, and administrators) in three healthcare-related settings, the study conceptualizes distributed IT championing as a process constituted of multiple individuals’ behaviors, unfolding over time, that proactively go beyond formal job requirements in support of an IT implementation. While multiple individuals may enact similar championing behaviors, the data indicate that multiple individuals may also enact distinct, yet complementary, championing behaviors over the course of the IT implementation. Overall, distributed IT championing evolves through cycles of distinct stages of bridging-in, bonding, and bridging-out, with each stage being shaped by different dimensions of social capital. Also, IT artifacts that are particularly generative appear more conducive to distributed IT championing than closed ones.

We also identify how recent IT developments, especially in relation to social software and the digitization of everything, are presenting new opportunities (and challenges) for how organizations can manage both knowledge and knowledge work.

 abstract = {For many organizations, maintaining and upgrading enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems (large packaged application software) is often far more costly than the initial implementation. Systematic planning and knowledge of the fundamental maintenance processes and maintenance-related management data are required in order to effectively and efficiently administer maintenance activities. This paper reports a revelatory case study of Government Services Provider (GSP), a high-performing ERP service provider to government agencies in Australia. GSP ERP maintenance-process and maintenance-data standards are compared with the IEEE/EIA 12207 software engineering standard for custom software, also drawing upon published research, to identify how practices in the ERP context diverge from the IEEE standard. While the results show that many best practices reflected in the IEEE standard have broad relevance to software generally, divergent practices in the ERP context necessitate a shift in management focus, additional responsibilities, and different maintenance decision criteria. Study findings may provide useful guidance to practitioners, as well as input to the IEEE and other related standards.},

@article{NgosiBraganza2009,
 abstract = {This article is about a proposal to develop a component-based design (CBD) framework of the international information technology standardization (IITS) process. This process is criticized widely in information systems (IS) literatures for its complexity as a barrier to successful project development. These criticisms have not challenged this process itself or accede to proactive action toward positive changes. We stress the importance of reconstructing this process within a CBD framework, not only to reduce sources of complexity but also to give special prominence of project development. Primarily, our qualitative empirical case study of five projects is grounded in the organization information processing theory (OIPT) as a lens. Theorizing from the qualitative empirical evidence we define the IITS process, followed by its inductive analysis guided by OIPT as a lens through three levels: its environment, content and performance. Through this lens we articulate assumptions about IITS process complexity. From rich descriptions of this process, we combine selected dimensions of CBD and OIPT as a lens to develop the theoretical depth of concepts that add detail to our CBD framework. One implication for practice of this framework is for provisioning incisive IITS process change strategies drawing upon its dominating qualities. This article makes three contributions to the IS field: this CBD framework is a key contribution. We bridge the gap in knowledge by defining the IITS process, explicating its complexity toward proactive action. By using OIPT as a lens we extend its application.},

 abstract = {This article draws on the evidence gathered from a corporate social responsibility (CSR) research project in the area of global information technology (IT) outsourcing to examine the impact of liminality. IT outsourcing offers a novel context to study this phenomena, as it operates across the boundaries of both firm and country. The case study focuses on the specific project of a school in India, as the liminal space found ‘betwixt and between’ the client and provider of IT outsourcing services. Three stages of liminality are identified: separation (divestiture), transition (liminality) and incorporation (investiture); through the interpretive analysis of the empirical material. The construct of communitas is proposed for analysing the impact of liminality on the relationship between an outsourcing client and the provider. The understanding of liminality and communitas has both theoretical and practical implications, and contributes to the understanding of relationships and the wider role of CSR in global IT outsourcing.},

 abstract = {We investigate the emerging meanings of “value” associated with the Internet of Things. Given the current political economy, we argue that the multiple meanings of “value” cannot be reduced to a single domain or discipline, but rather they are invariably articulated at the juxtaposition of three domains: social, economic, and technical. We analyse each of these domains and present domain challenges and cross-domain implications – drawing from an interdisciplinary literature review and gap analysis across sources from academia, business, and governments. We propose a functional model that aggregates these findings into a value-driven logic of the emerging global political economy enabled by digital technology in general and IoT in particular. These conceptual contributions highlight the critical need for an interdisciplinary understanding of the meaning of “value”, so that IoT services and products will create and sustain such concurrent meanings during their entire lifecycle, from design to consumption and retirement or recycling.},

 abstract = {How do we critically evaluate the social impact of the information and communications technology (ICT) that, in the developed world at least, is central to both economy and society. Market-oriented, functionalist and instrumental views tend to dominate discourse on ICT and the purpose of this paper is to challenge such views by suggesting a critical neo-humanist alternative. Harvey's critical analysis of recent industrial society, Aristotle's concept of phronesis and Heidegger's tool analysis set the scene for the main argument of the paper based on Habermas’ theory of communicative action. Using an illustrative case vignette from the Irish community sector, the paper argues that this theory provides potentially valid philosophical and social theoretical guidelines for a critical interpretive evaluation of the social impact of ICT that focuses attention on normative (‘lifeworld’) as distinct from instrumental (‘system’) forms of rationality.},

 abstract = {Although many countries are attempting to build an information infrastructure and accelerate the adoption of broadband Internet access technology, the results are not always satisfactory. The focus of earlier research on the diffusion and adoption of broadband Internet access has been primarily on the construction of a national-level infrastructure or on macro-level factors such as government policies, market competition and the density of population. This research highlights the individual-level factors affecting the adoption of broadband access, integrating various views on the adoption and diffusion of technology, including the technology acceptance model, theory of planned behaviour and diffusion of innovation model. An extended technology acceptance model incorporating the notion of perceived resources is proved to be relevant in the adoption of broadband technologies. It was found that innovation attributes, such as compatibility, visibility and result demonstrability, have an impact on constructs in the extended technology acceptance model such as perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and perceived resources. These results also support the idea that congruent experiences and opportunities in adopting a new technology affect user attitudes through the three extended technology acceptance model constructs above. This research suggests that efforts should be made to expand the compatible experience base of broadband Internet in order to facilitate its adoption and use. This paper also provides an extensive review of the adoption behaviour of individuals by incorporating different views and theories.},

 abstract = {The mobile ecosystem has recently experienced a transition in platform leadership from network operators to mobile operating system providers. In each system the platform provider exerts effort in order to attract other firms for generativity and profitability. In this paper, we identify and analyze the working mechanism of one business practice that significantly influences the ecosystem's generativity and platform provider's profitability via value appropriation. Revenue sharing has become a common practice in the mobile ecosystem following NTT DoCoMo's radical revenue-sharing model contributing toward mobile service success in Japan. Studies further argue that offering a wide portfolio of services through an attractive or innovative revenue-sharing model is one of key success factors in the mobile ecosystem. However, app developers have continuously claimed that they do not receive their fair share and the press reports a substantial number of disputes concerning revenue sharing between the platform provider and app developers. We propose a new bargaining model, the modified apex game, that investigates how value is likely to be appropriated between the platform provider and app developers within a given mobile platform mediated network. We support our theoretical predictions using data collected from the early mobile ecosystem by a network operator as well as the iOS and Android mediated networks.},

 abstract = {A multi-sided platform can only succeed if a critical mass of users can join. This is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for a platform's success. However, there is a limited understanding of the factors that contribute to reaching such critical mass. In this study we identify ways to determine the market potential of a platform and to reach critical mass. We particularly enrich past studies by exploring how the openness of a platform influences market potential. We examine openness at three levels – provider, technology, and user level – and ask the question: to what extent can opening (or closing) each level increase or decrease a platform's market potential? The provider level recognizes the strategic involvement of key stakeholders that provide a platform. The technology level is concerned with the interoperability of a platform across different technologies. The user level relates to what extent a platform discriminates different segments of the customer base. On the basis of analytical modeling and theoretical analysis, we formulate four propositions concerning the effects of openness on platforms’ market potential. We illustrate the strength of propositions through a confirmatory case study, which is informed by five theoretically sampled cases. The cases illustrate cogently the effects of opening different levels of a multi-sided platform. In conclusion, we propose a decision model that can assist decision making concerning the opening of a platform to catalyze its growth.},

 abstract = {Innovation through outsourcing can be hindered as a result of opportunistic behaviour. As a remedy, the extant literature encourages firms to enhance familiarity between the parties and/or consider using advisory services. In this paper, we seek to examine the effect of knowledge familiarity (client-supplier and supplier-client) and relational familiarity on innovation outcomes. Further, we also examine whether the presence of advisors improves innovation outcomes. Our results suggest that a higher degree of relational familiarity and client-supplier knowledge familiarity are associated with better innovation outcomes. We also reveal that client-supplier knowledge familiarity mediates the effect of supplier-client knowledge familiarity on innovation outcomes. We did not find support for the direct effect of advisors on innovation outcomes. Instead, the presence of advisors moderates the effect of supplier-client and relational familiarity on innovation outcomes. We consider the implications for the IS outsourcing literature and practice.},

To achieve this objective, we examine changes that multinationals introduced in their offshore captive investments concerning the type of the captive they set up, the functions they offshored through a captive centre and to which location. Information was collected from secondary sources on offshore captive investments made by Fortune 250 global firms between 1985 and 2010.

 abstract = {Continuous development extends the agile approach and focuses on bringing valuable services to users with the aim of achieving a continuous flow of learning and development in short cycles. The objective of this work is to theorize the idea of continuous development in the context of digital infrastructure evolution and explore the organizational interactions underlying continuous development. By drawing on literature on digital infrastructure theory and continuous development as it has emerged as an idea from the DevOps thinking expanded from agile, we outline main characteristics of continuous development and propose a theoretical definition of continuous development in organizational contexts. Then, in answering our research question “which patterns of interactions can be identified in the continuous development of digital infrastructures?”, we conducted a longitudinal case study at a Norwegian grid company and explored how a specific digital infrastructure evolved through continuous development. We identified generic interaction patterns with two cycles of sense-giving and sense-making between organizational actors, enabling the continuous development of the digital infrastructure. Our findings and model of interaction patterns offer a nuanced perspective on both digital infrastructure evolution and established views of sense-making and sense-giving mechanisms, as well as new ways to think about digitalization in incumbent firms.},

Although there is some evidence on the usefulness of mobile viral marketing from the marketers’ perspective, little is known about the motivations, attitudes, and behaviors of consumers engaged in this marketing instrument. The purpose of this research is to better understand the motivations behind a consumer's decision to engage in mobile viral marketing strategies. The outcome is a grounded theory of mobile viral marketing with respect to the consumer and his social network, decomposing the mobile viral effect and identifying the determinants of reception, usage, and forwarding of mobile viral content. This result helps researchers and marketers to better understand the critical components of mobile viral marketing strategies and prepares the ground for further research in this emerging field.},

The multi-stakeholder (MS) and multilateral (ML) forms have been presented as two competing and plausible models of Internet governance. Drawing on actor–network theory (ANT) and building on an interpretive case study of rich archival data, this paper examines how the focal actor’s (i.e. the U.S. government’s) beliefs influence the choice of Internet governance form. It further explores the strategies of the focal actor to translate the interests of the ML network’s supporters, with a view to enrolling them in the MS governance network. The analysis shows how the focal actor has established the MS governance form through the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) as an Obligatory Passage Point to keep the Internet successfully operational. The analysis also illuminates the combination of structural and collaborative strategies employed to allay the growing dissatisfaction with the MS governance form. The paper suggests that whilst the protocols and technical standards of the Internet are increasingly relegated to the background, the social and political network that Internet artefacts draw together in a meta-form has grown in prominence.

@article{PangLeeDeLone2014,
 abstract = {What value does information technology (IT) create in governments and how does it do so? While business value of IT has been extensively studied in the information systems field, this has not been the case for public value. This is in part due to a lack of theoretical bases for investigating IT value in the public sector. To address this issue, we present a conceptual model on the mechanism by which IT resources contribute to value creation in the public-sector organizations. We propose that the relationship between IT resources and organizational performance in governments is mediated by organizational capabilities and develop a theoretical model that delineates the paths from IT resources to organizational performance, drawing upon public-value management theory. This theory asserts that public managers, on behalf of the public, should actively strive to generate greater public value, as managers in the private sector seek to achieve greater private business value. On the basis of the review of public-value management literature, we suggest that the following five organizational capabilities mediate the relationship between IT resources and public value - public service delivery capability, public engagement capability, co-production capability, resource-building capability, and public-sector innovation capability. We argue that IT resources in public organizations can enable public managers to advance public-value frontiers by cultivating these five organizational capabilities and to overcome conflicts among competing values.},

@article{ParrShanks2000a,
 abstract = {Problems with the implementation of ERP systems are well documented. Although companies spend millions on ERP packages and the implementation process, there is extensive evidence that they experience considerable problems, particularly during the actual implementation project. This paper presents a project phase model (PPM) of ERP implementation projects that is a synthesis of existing ERP implementation process models and focuses on the implementation project. Two case studies of ERP implementation within the same organization, one unsuccessful and a later successful one, are reported and analysed in order to determine which critical success factors (CSFs) are necessary within each phase of the PPM. The CSFs are drawn from an earlier stage of this research and from recent literature. The PPM is used as a ‘lens’ for understanding ERP implementation projects, by highlighting the differences between the two cases. We then offer an explanation for these differences, focusing particularly on the successful case. Firstly, the organizational learning that occurred during the unsuccessful project and the associated early appointment of an experienced ‘champion’ with clearly defined responsibilities were critical to the successful project. Secondly, organizations implementing ERP systems should partition large projects into several smaller, simpler projects identified here as ‘vanilla’ implementations. The PPM, together with associated CSFs, provides guidance for practitioners when planning ERP implementation projects and also provides researchers with a foundation for further empirical research.},

 abstract = {This article furthers a sociomaterial framework to examine inter-organizational boundaries in government IT projects. It engages in a dialogue with the practice theory-based approach to boundary spanning and utilizes analytical tools and epistemologies drawn from the social studies of technology. It aims to contribute to a situated, material understanding of inter-organizational boundaries. We argue that boundaries in outsourcing relationships can be de facto enacted through definitions of what counts as relevant knowledge. Information systems have a key role in eliciting such definitions, thus establishing knowledge asymmetries and regimes of inclusion and exclusion. The article responds to the call to value the role of artefacts in IT research. Furthermore, it eventually shows that understanding knowledge asymmetries triggered at the micro-level of information systems can help to examine macro-scale transformations between the public and the private sectors. To illustrate the framework, two ethnographic case studies of governmental IT projects are discussed. The first case concerns a permit and licence submission service in Italy. The second case analyses a 20-year-long database integration carried on at the Dutch land registry. In the first case, information systems made relevant a form of knowledge developed by contractors; in the second case, the integration process valued knowledge developed in-house. Three sets of implications are drawn for the theory and practice of inter-organizational IT projects. To conclude, the article focuses on inter-organizational boundaries involving the public and the private sectors and foresees a novel interdisciplinary research direction at the confluence of information systems and political studies.},

 abstract = {A large-scale postal survey and six in-depth case studies on information architecture practice were carried out from 1992 to 1994 in the UK. The research findings suggest information architecture to be a useful information systems planning tool. The study further redefines information architecture's core components and concludes that the careful targeting and development of these components – business system architecture, application architecture and data architecture – can contribute to the effectiveness and efficiency of information systems planning and implementation.},

 abstract = {As part of a research programme on key information systems (IS) management issues, a survey of Australasia's largest organizations was conducted to identify which issues were perceived by their chief executive officers (CEOs) as being important, problematic and critical over the next 3–5 years. The results reported are based on a moderate response rate (though perhaps reasonable for the target group) but formal testing showed an absence of non-response bias. The most critical issues were revealed to be a mix of technology management issues (managing and measuring the effectiveness of the information technology (IT) infrastructure, and disaster recovery), strategic management issues (business process redesign, competitive advantage, and information architecture), people and support management issues (organizational learning, and executive and decision support) and systems development and data management issues (effective use of the data resource and effectiveness of software development). This reflects their interest in a wide range of issues, but all with an organization-wide focus. The non-critical issues were mostly related to the individual technologies and the place and role of IS in the organization. While the CEOs showed some agreement with their chief information officers (CIOs) on issues such as the IT infrastructure, competitive advantage and organizational learning, some distinct differences exist, particularly in relation to the quality and effectiveness of systems and processes and also how CEOs and CIOs perceive the IT knowledge of the CEOs.},

The process ensures that sponsors not only understand the impact of the investment on key operating variables but also take responsibility for ensuring the improved performance.},

In particular, it is affected by the implicit ‘contract’ between the team and the organization. This contract is controlled through the adherence to formal methodologies and the use of organizational control system. This paper looks at risk management from the point of view of team behaviour, focusing on behavioural response to risks in terms of effort and risk aversion. Three case studies of project team behaviour are used to illustrate the types of risk management behaviour which may arise under different contracts between project team and organization.},

 abstract = {Much interest has been generated recently by the concept of intranets: the use of internet technology to build the communication and data storage infrastructure of the firm. While the advantages of such a concept have been widely publicized, the risks of moving to an intranet based infrastructure are less clear. ‘Fear of the unknown’ may deter some firms from taking advantage of intranets. This empirical study is based in Singapore, a country chosen for its high internet penetration and usage levels. It investigates the factors underlying successful intranet developments. Intranet success as measured by user satisfaction is related to IS management risk factors. It is found that successful intranet implementation can be largely explained by standard determinants of IS success. Some implications for management of intranet developments are discussed.},

 abstract = {This paper examines public discourse in order to illuminate the processes by which issues of anonymity, surveillance, security, and privacy are integrated into public understandings of, and interactions with, consumer payment systems. Using theories of the social construction of technology, and Gamson's model of issue construction, it analyses the issue package deployed by the developer of the Ecash electronic payment system. An issue package is a set of framing devices which focus and constrain discussion of a particular issue. The paper then analyses three different discursive sites (print media, US Congressional deliberation, and an electronic mailing list) to gauge the success of that package, according to its presence and its resonance within each site. Using theories of frame alignment and social mobilization, the package is identified as a globalizing framing strategy. Its failure is explained by the difficulties a frame of such structure will have in meshing with the discursive practice of each site, in resonating with cultural themes of each site, and in provoking social action.},

@article{PisaniasWillcocks1999a,
 abstract = {Debate on the impact of the Internet on socioeconomic and business environments has been dominated by technological determinist perspectives, narrowing the range of discourse around the implications of these new technologies. One important and neglected dimension is the impact on market relationships. Technological determinism suggests that the transactional efficiencies associated with the new medium should have a major impact on market structures. If that argument is correct, the case should be stronger in broking markets where information exchange, information mediation and communication flows are paramount. However, an examination of various broking markets reveals significant differences in the implications of this technological innovation. Drawing upon participant observation research conducted in 1998–99 in the shipbroking market, the paper explores the limitations of the technological determinist perspective and puts forward a model to explore the changing nature and dynamics of market relationships generated by information flows via the Internet. Application of the model helps to locate the reasons for slow adoption of the Internet in ship-broking markets.},

 abstract = {ERP systems are increasingly accessible to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). If the potential benefits of these systems are significant, the same applies to the risk associated with their implementation. A number of authors emphasize that IS risk management is most effective when it is initiated at the earliest possible moment in the system's lifecycle, that is, at the adoption phase. But how do SMEs actually manage the risk of ERP implementation during the ERP adoption process? The research objectives are (1) to identify and describe the influence of the SMEs’ context on their implementation risk exposure, and (2) to understand whether and how, within the adoption process, SMEs actually manage the risk of implementing an ERP system supplied by an ERP vendor, with open source software, or through in-house development. In order to do so, four case studies of SMEs having implemented an ERP system were undertaken. The study shows that to manage risk at the adoption stage, SMEs can proceed in a rather intuitive, informal and unstructured manner, that is explicitly based however upon an architecture of basic principles, policies and practices.},

This is counter to the prevailing assumptions of cloud adoption as being more impersonal and distant, with less interaction between provider and purchaser than on-premise technologies. We do this through an interpretive study of cloud computing adopters across Europe. We develop a conceptual framework of cloud proximity which draws attention to its locational, relational and temporal proximal dimensions. Our proximal analysis leads us to identify three aspects of cloud adoption where proximity plays a key role: mercantile aspect (e.g., cloud sales support), counsel aspect (e.g., access to internal and external expertise) and organi-technical aspect (e.g., the understanding of cloud technology and services alongside their organizational adoption context). By challenging assumptions of distant and remote adoption, we contribute to the cloud computing adoption research and raise questions for IT adoption in general.},

 abstract = {Traditional methods of systems design have tended to concentrate on capturing functional requirements and from them develop a system that will provide users with a technical solution to a problem they may have. However, there is a growing understanding, with historical origins in sociotechnical systems theory, that technical solutions alone, regardless of how well designed, may not succeed fully unless there is a concomitant understanding of the organization into which the technical solution is to be introduced. Organizational requirements, therefore, should become considerations of equal importance to systems designers. The ESPRIT Project ORDIT (organizational requirements definition for information technology) has developed a methodology which identifies and operationalizes organizational requirements for IT systems. This paper presents a case study in which the ORDIT concepts are applied to the process of introducing an IT system into a courtroom.},

Empirical evidence is provided by three case studies representing three classic types of client-consultant relationships. We draw on two complementary perspectives: possession view (i.e., power and knowledge are based on resources that can be owned or controlled by individuals) and practice view (i.e., power and knowledge are relational in nature and exercised in action). The paper develops a framework that shows that power and knowledge are closely intertwined and that the possession and practice views are complementary in understanding configurable technology projects. The paper also demonstrates the importance of the initial set-up of the project and how knowing/powering mechanisms can reinforce or change implementation trajectories, which, in turn, can affect project results.},

 abstract = {This paper focuses on local adaptations, referring to the significant or subtle changes local firms make in their local business processes and rules in order to fit with a generic application system, and to the changes they make in the features of a generic application system. Local adaptations are therefore bidirectional in nature. Although several studies stress the importance of local adaptations for the overall success of information technologies (IT) used across locations, more research is needed regarding what kind of local adaptations are required for a particular generic application system to work well in particular localities. The nature and extent of local adaptations are still poorly understood. This paper provides a concrete illustration of a historically situated local adaptation: the case of Veiling Holambra. This Brazilian cooperative has imported a generic auction marketplace model from Holland and adapted it to local conditions, to succeed in a globalized and competitive flower market. Using concepts drawn from studies on globalization, cross-cultural implementations, and IT-based organizational change literature, we put forward three propositions that help to explain the success of local adaptations. The results of our case study indicate that the immigration of Dutch people was critical for bringing knowledge of cooperative structure and flower production to Holambra and led to a relatively small design-use gap. The ability to take local, contextual requirements into account without neglecting the ‘generic’ knowledge led to the successful implementation of the generic auction model. This mutual influence was particularly enabled by the Brazilian culture of improvization.},

The case presents how an Internet-based collaboration platform was implemented to address the strategic issue of increasing shelf availability and customer service in grocery retailing, an issue that has emerged as one of the major confrontations for the whole sector over the past years. The case presented shows the challenges of executing such strategic collaborative supply-chain initiatives which, although arguably beneficial, can be hindered by IT adoption failures. A longitudinal view of the case is presented, from an initial pilot back in 2001 to the final success in 2005. We discuss the particular challenges of the execution of Internet-enabled collaborative supply-chain initiatives as well as possible managerial actions through a simple framework we develop based on the lessons from the case.},

 abstract = {The advent of ‘digital’ ways of working and organising is unequivocally transforming the very fabric of work, leading to an increasingly uncertain, unsettled, and fluid environment. Research has traditionally anchored worker identity in fixed and place-bound concepts. However, in the digital workplace, where work is more akin to a performance, unfolding over time, and processual in nature, our understanding of work and theories of worker identity are called into question. In this paper, we ask the question: how is digital worker identity performed in such fluid and unsettled work settings? To explain digital worker identity performance, we investigate digital nomadism as an extremely fluid and unsettled case of digital work. We study digital nomads, high-skilled professionals who use digital technologies to work remotely and lead a nomadic lifestyle, in a multi-sited ethnographic field study. Based on a process-relational perspective, we are theorising how the identity of digital nomads, their “becoming,” is performed as an ongoing process along lines of identity performance. This is an intermediate “product of theorising,” in accord with the aim of the special issue, but provides a foundation for a novel process-relational theory of identity performance in unsettled digital work.},

 abstract = {An organization depends on quality information for effective operations and decisionmaking. However, there is still no agreement as to how quality should be defined in terms of specific quality categories and criteria. Proposed information quality frameworks have limitations with respect to either consistency, resulting from a non-theoretical approach to framework development, or scope, considering only objective but not subjective information quality perspectives. In this paper, we describe a unique research approach to framework development that addresses these problems and compare it to those used previously for other frameworks. Semiotic theory, the philosophical theory of signs, is used to ensure rigor and scope. It provides a theoretical basis for framework structure - quality categories and their criteria - and for integrating objective and subjective quality views. Empirical refinement based on academic, practitioner, and end-user focus groups is then used to ensure relevance.},

 abstract = {Software development project managers may need to focus on particular issues during the development process for a variety of reasons, including limited resources. This study utilized a survey to ask software practitioners, who are at the core of development, to provide insight into some of the important early non-technical issues of software development, including those related to sponsor/senior management, customer/users and requirements management. Proposed relationships among these early items, and their relationship to software practitioners’ perception of project success, were quantitatively represented through a proposed Bayesian Belief Network. The concept of ‘success’ was derived from a pilot study of practitioners and was ‘defined’ as (a) there is a project plan, (b) the project is well planned, (c) practitioners have a sense of achievement while working on a project, (d) practitioners have a sense of doing a good job (i.e. delivered quality) while working on a project, and (e) requirements are accepted by the development team as realistic/achievable. The proposed causal model provided quantitative evidence that reaching agreement with customers/users on requirements, a high level of customer/user participation, and users who make adequate time for requirements gathering have the largest direct impacts on project success among the investigated items. The proposed model identified the following as the critical chain of events for success: (1) Having a sponsor throughout the project, (2) users who make adequate time for requirements gathering, (3) a high level of customer/user participation in the development process, and (4) agreement on requirements between customer/users and the development team.},

 abstract = {The notion of employee empowerment in today's organizations is becoming increasingly important with the growing degree of responsibility individual employees hold. This paper presents the findings of a longitudinal study which examined the relationship between computer-based information systems (IS) and empowerment in detail drawing heavily on empirical work carried out in the British manufacturing industry. The paper elaborates and discusses the conceptual issues which are relevant to the idea of empowerment and its relationship with IS, before determining empowerment to be in essence the decentralization of decision-making authority to lower levels of the organization. The lack of any research on this topic led us to carry out a combination of empirical research. A large-scale postal survey of 450 UK manufacturing companies followed by a series of 20 in-depth interviews in 18 top UK manufacturing organizations formed the basis for this paper. The findings confirmed that empowerment is indeed pursued by many UK manufacturing organizations within their various efforts at improving their organization of work. The research participants viewed IS as an important enabling tool for empowerment offering many opportunities, but clearly noted that the role of IS in this is supportive rather than initiating; IS do not lead to employees becoming empowered. However, the interviews revealed that manufacturing organizations are facing a wide range of problems and difficulties with their existing IS raising a number of constraints. The paper concludes with a number of practical suggestions for using IS as a supportive means for empowering employees.},

 abstract = {As digitization becomes pervasive, many organizations struggle to drive value from the growing number of IT-related opportunities. We show how the drivers of IT value creation can be framed as firm-wide commitments to a set of IT capabilities. On the basis of 20 published case studies, we identify a small set of IT decisions that organizations must make to use IT to successfully enhance their impact. We group these decisions into a framework of four commitments. Making these commitments helps organizations reinforce what really matters over time, which in turn helps focus the attention of their employees. We demonstrate, via a survey of 210 publicly traded firms, that firms which are more effective in making these four commitments have higher business impact from IT, which in turn correlates with higher financial performance. We suggest the construct of commitment is a step toward unifying the IT value literature and creating an overarching concept that brings together many of the important management practices identified in previous work.},

 abstract = {Software is acknowledged to be crucial in enabling the widespread diffusion of information technology (IT), but is inadequately dealt with in analyses of technological change and often misrepresented in accounts of IT phenomena. The tools that are used to analyse conventional innovation processes are found to be inappropriatte for software. The characteristics of software which present conceptual difficulty, and the features which drive change in the software development process are identified. Three lines of technological development in software are discussed: product diffusion, innovation in the organization and management of the development process, and innovation in technical practice. These reflect currently dominant and emergent trends, in particular the shift away from wholly custom-built towards packaged software; concern with process issues, including quality accreditation; and technical developments including CASE (computer aided software engineering) and object orientation. A framework is proposed which supports analysis of the distinctions and interactions between technical practice and organizational aspects of the development process, and also explains the interdependence between product diffusion and process innovation.},

Specifically, we report on primary and secondary empirical data that spans a 44-year period pertaining to the uses made of the Amazon rainforest monitoring system (a set of satellite-based geographic information systems). This paper argues that: (1) the process of institutional change is conflictual, emergent and contested; (2) the design and use of IT artefacts tend to reflect the currently dominant conceptions of control; (3) that IT artefacts that emerge within a specific conception of control can be later reconfigured to serve the interests of other conceptions of control; (4) and finally, IT artefacts might unintentionally reinforce alternate conceptions of control and lead to institutional change.},

@article{RajaoMarcolino2016,
 abstract = {In this paper, we draw upon Goffman's symbolic interactionism to analyze the ways in which new users in developing countries have adopted ICT to present and manage contradictory self-images to different groups of the public. In particular, we show that the Acapú, an indigenous group in the Amazon, present themselves through online videos and websites as ideal Indians: innate forest stewards aiming to mitigate climate change and ensure the planet's environmental sustainability. At the same time, the Acapú are also represented through a complex computer simulation model as destructive “cowboys”: farmers and ranchers who are willing to develop by clearing their forests in the absence of financial compensation. This research shows that these two opposing self-images, while contradictory, are necessary for the implementation of REDD projects (a payment mechanism for reducing greenhouse emissions from deforestation). In order to obtain carbon credits from avoided deforestation, the project relies on the difference between deforestation measurements and high levels of predicted deforestation, which in turn, depend on the presentation of destructive self-images through the use of a complex computer simulation. But to sell these credits on a voluntary carbon market, it is necessary for the Acapú to openly market a self-image through the Internet which is attractive to corporate buyers willing to boost their eco-friendly profile. Based on this analysis, the paper challenges the narrative whereby Southern ICT users are passive receivers of technological black boxes. In contrast, it shows that in some cases these new users may participate in the creation of ICT artifacts to manage the impressions of distant audiences. Furthermore, the paper calls attention to the role of computer simulations and other ICT applications in concealing the paradoxes of neoliberal environmental management practices.},

 abstract = {In this article, we assert that compassion-driven approaches are the sustainable way for information and communication technologies to contribute to economic value. We urge future information systems research to emphasize, with equal vigor, the joint goals of compassion and financial gains from information and communication technologies.

 abstract = {While information technology has been recognized as critically important for supporting global business strategy, the contingent relationships between salient dimensions of an information technology and key sources of competitive advantage have not been systematically explicated and discussed in the literature. Instead, a universal view of the role of information technology in developing competitive advantage for a firm is often adopted. Taking a contingency perspective, this paper more systematically examines the links among global business strategies, global information technologies (GIT) and competitive advantage within an integrative framework. Additionally, the issue of sustainability of GIT-based competitive advantages is addressed using the conceptual tool kits of the I/O (industrial organization)-based and resource-based theories of strategic management. The proposed conceptual model provides an encompassing framework for future research on the increasingly important topic of global information technology and its potential to generate competitive advantage for firms.},

The advantages offered by the Internet have determined many companies to adopt different models of Internet-enabled distribution strategy. The choice and the implementation of these strategies will be influenced, as in the case of any other marketing channel, by the characteristics of the company, of its clients, and of the traded products. On the basis of an empirical study of 500 Internet commercial sites, the present paper identifies the models of Internet-enabled distribution strategy implemented by the Web-active companies, and then verifies four hypotheses related to the factors that influence the choice and implementation of a particular strategy.},

@article{Randell2007,
 abstract = {This paper contains a set of personal views relating to NHS Connecting for Health's National Programme for IT (NPfIT), and in particular its Care Records Service, written from the point of view of a computer scientist, not a medical informatics expert. The principal points made are as follows: Centralisation: Pulling lots of data together (for individual patients and then for large patient populations) harms safety and privacy – it is one byproduct of excessive use of identification when in fact all that is usually needed is authentication. Large centralized data storage facilities can be useful for reliability, but risk exchanging lots of small failures for a lesser number of much larger failures. A much more decentralised approach to electronic patient record (EPR) data and its storage should be investigated. Evolutionary acquisition: Specifying, implementing, deploying and evaluating a sequence of ever more complete IT systems is the best way of ending up with well-accepted and well-trusted systems – especially when this process is controlled by the stakeholders who are most directly involved, rather than by some distant central bureaucracy. Thus authority as well as responsibility should be left with hospital and general practitioner trusts to acquire IT systems that suit their environments and priorities – subject to adherence to minimal interoperability constraints – and to use centralized services (e.g., for system support and back-up) as if and when they choose. Socio-technical issues: Ill-chosen imposed medical IT systems impede patient care, are resisted, result in lots of accidental faults, and lose user support and trust. All these points are attested to by rigorous studies involving expertise from the social sciences (psychology, ethnography, etc.) as well as by technical (medical and computer) experts – much more attention needs to be paid to such studies, and more such studies encouraged. Constructive reviews: A constructive expert review, working closely with Connecting for Health, could be very helpful, but should be evidently independent and open and thus essentially different in nature to past and current inquiries. A review of this nature could not just recommend appropriate changes of plan, and speed progress. It could also contribute to the vital task of helping to restore the trust and confidence of the public and the media in the programme and in the government officials involved.},

In order to evaluate their potential relevance to managing information technology (IT), several aspects of service management are explored, including the nature of service products, customer-supplier contact, the design of service delivery systems, and measuring and achieving service quality. Some ideas have already been applied to IT, but others could also be relevant. These include examining contacts between users and IT specialists, using process flow charts to design IT services, and employing service quality measures in IT management. A general model is proposed for managing IT service quality; the application of this model at the strategic level of firms is examined.},

In response to the business challenges that arose due to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the company decided to outsource many of its IT activities to an Indian vendor. This case traces the key decisions made by the CIO and the challenges that were encountered during the planning and execution of the company's offshore sourcing strategy. These decisions pertain to the choice of tasks to be offshored, decisions about the vendor and the nature of sourcing arrangement, managing the vendor relationship and change management issues induced by offshoring. As GlobShop nears the completion of its 3-year agreement with the offshore vendor, the CIO is faced with decisions regarding continuing offshore outsourcing, extending the contract and related implications for the future of IT organization at GlobShop.},

 abstract = {Knowledge management has become a major trend since the mid-1990s. Different professional communities, among them information systems/information technology (IS/IT) and more business management-oriented actors, have created strong conceptual ties with the idea of managing knowledge. This paper studies the structure and development of the knowledge management discourse over an 18-year period with an emphasis on the role of the IS/IT community in shaping this discourse. In order to do so, a content analysis of 434 article abstracts from the ABI/Inform database referring to ‘knowledge management’ was performed. The argument here is based on a theoretical framework derived from recent theorizing about popular management knowledge as fashion and it is assumed that different professional or ‘speech communities’ gathering around a concept such as knowledge management enter into competition for limited organizational resources. The paper's findings show the co-existence of two distinct speech communities involved in the knowledge management debate, focusing on either IS/IT or general management issues and they support the idea that both communities engage in a joint effort at sustaining knowledge management as a fashion field.},

 abstract = {How does the introduction of enterprise social networking affect the way that geographically dispersed managers communicate with each other? We examine enterprise social network (ESN) usage data obtained from a community of store managers in a leading Australian retail organization, over a period of 15 months after introduction of the platform. Our interest in examining this data is in spatial communication preferences by the network users, that is, to ascertain who is communicating with whom and where. Our analysis of 12,000 messages exchanged between 530 managers shows that interactions can generally be characterized by individual preferences for local communication but also that two different user communities exist - ‘locals’ and ‘globals’. We develop empirical profiles for these two types of social network user communities, and we compare the empirical results against contrasting theoretical perspectives for spatial preference patterns in communication behaviour. We outline implications for theories on spatial influences on communication behaviours on ESNs.},

 abstract = {This paper reports on research conducted by the authors into how to measure the effectiveness of a personal computer network used by a business school to deliver a range of personal productivity tools to MBA students, as well as academic and administrative staff. The use of user-satisfaction is recognized by many IT researchers as an appropriate surrogate for IT effectiveness. The authors decided to use a user-satisfaction model which is based on the gap between users’ beliefs of what is important and their perception of what is delivered by the ISD, to measure the effectiveness of the personal computer network. In brief, the research showed that all was not well with the personal computer network in use. The gaps on the two perceptual performance factors, namely effective benefits and system access, are significant in assessing overall satisfaction with the network. The gap on effective benefits is approximately twice as important as system's access in terms of its impact on overall satisfaction. This research study showed that this gap approach is quite effective. It is inexpensive. It does not require an enormous amount of expertize, although an acquaintance with factor analysis is necessary. The study need not take a long period of time; the total lapse time for the above research was six weeks, requiring the equivalent of five person-days work.},

An appreciation of these issues is essential before any professional research may be conducted either for general academic publication or for a higher degree. This paper discusses, in general terms, the nature of academic research and how the scientific method is used in practice. It identifies three major categories of research and explains the steps which the research needs to follow if a claim is to be made that a significant addition has been made to the collection of knowledge.

 abstract = {Assessing the business impacts of increased IT investment has become one of the major issues in contemporary management. Many senior managers realize that a well-structured appraisal process might make the vital difference between IT success and IT failure, both in the private and the public sectors. Senior management's prime concern has shifted from controlling IT costs to managing and delivering IT benefits. Today, increased emphasis is being put on the role of infrastructure investments in order to fully exploit the profit potential of IT. The infrastructure impact of IT investments more and more centres around the emerging notion of an information infrastructure. Assessing the role and impacts of infrastructure investments, however, has proved to be particularly difficult and it is not yet clear how the underlying strategic decision-making process should be managed. The purpose of this paper is to present a model that offers four control options – paraphrasing conventional business wisdom in marketing coined the ‘P4 model’ – to manage investment appraisal and to support organizational decision-making. As a prelude to this, the paper explores the role of an information infrastructure from an IT investment perspective and examines four styles of decision-making. It also presents case study material from the financial services sector, in order to illustrate the relevance and applicability of the P4 model. Much of this paper draws on a research study funded by Eindhoven University and two large financial services organizations.},

@article{RenwickGleasure2021,
 abstract = {Blockchain systems afford new privacy capabilities. This threatens to create conflict, as different social groups involved in blockchain development often disagree on which capabilities specific systems should enact. This article adopts a boundary object perspective to make sense of disagreements between collaborating social worlds. We perform a case study of privacy attitudes among collaborating actors in Monero, a cryptocurrency community that emphasises privacy and decentralisation alongside a set of values sometimes described as anti-establishment, crypto-anarchist, and/or cypherpunk. The case study performs a series of interviews with users, developers, cryptographic researchers, corporate architects, and government regulators. Three novel and important findings emerge. The first is that none of the social worlds express a desire to monitor routine transactions, despite the obvious business and tax-collection value of such data. The second is that regulators are happy to postpone active involvement, based on the flawed assumption they can impose privacy-related regulation later, once risks have become clear.

@article{RenwickGleasure2021a,
 abstract = {Blockchain systems afford new privacy capabilities. This threatens to create conflict, as different social groups involved in blockchain development often disagree on which capabilities specific systems should enact. This article adopts a boundary object perspective to make sense of disagreements between collaborating social worlds. We perform a case study of privacy attitudes among collaborating actors in Monero, a cryptocurrency community that emphasises privacy and decentralisation alongside a set of values sometimes described as anti-establishment, crypto-anarchist, and/or cypherpunk. The case study performs a series of interviews with users, developers, cryptographic researchers, corporate architects, and government regulators. Three novel and important findings emerge. The first is that none of the social worlds express a desire to monitor routine transactions, despite the obvious business and tax-collection value of such data. The second is that regulators are happy to postpone active involvement, based on the flawed assumption they can impose privacy-related regulation later, once risks have become clear. Such regulation may not be possible as protocols and rulesets currently being coded into the system may be impossible to amend in the future (unless they can obtain either developer or network consensus). The third is that regulators assume methods for overseeing extraordinary transaction are necessary to avoid widespread, near-effortless money laundering. Yet, each of the other social worlds is operating under the assumption that this trade-off has already been accepted. These findings demonstrate subtle power transitions and changes in privacy attitudes that have implications for research on blockchain, management, and boundary objects in general.},

 abstract = {Attempts to summarise Claudio Ciborra's work through a single theme cannot succeed due to its breadth and the ease in which he moved between subjects. This paper is a tentative attempt to discover a common theme in his work, with the notion of knowledge identified as an appropriate starting point. Encompassing learning and rationality, the theme of knowledge has been persistent and evolving in Ciborra's work, with three knowledge combinations reflecting its development: knowledge-rationality, knowledge-learning and everyday-knowledge. The first combination depicts rationality as a catalyst in the pursuit of specific objectives that determine knowledge. Ciborra continued his exploration of knowledge by theorising that background knowledge structure objectives were the basis of sense-making and organisational action, while short-term knowledge structure was required to address developing situations. This introduced and provided the foundation for the knowledge-learning combination. Ciborra's final knowledge combination was predicated on the interpretation of reality as created by the experiences of the individual, including participation in organisational life where feelings, moods and the totality of existence is expressed, delineating the everyday-knowledge combination in the process. Ciborra utilised these and other approaches like the learning ladder in his investigation of complex multilayered subjects like information systems, undertaken from among others, a phenomenological vantage point that shaped many of his key contributions.},

 abstract = {The alignment of business and information technology (IT) strategies is an important and enduring theoretical challenge for the information systems discipline, remaining a top issue in practice over the past 20 years. Multi-business organizations (MBOs) present a particular alignment challenge because business strategies are developed at the corporate level, within individual strategic business units and across the corporate investment cycle. In contrast, the extant literature implicitly assumes that IT strategy is aligned with a single business strategy at a single point in time. This paper draws on resource-based theory and path dependence to model functional, structural, and temporal IT strategic alignment in MBOs. Drawing on Makadok's theory of profit, we show how each form of alignment creates value through the three strategic drivers of competence, governance, and flexibility, respectively. We illustrate the model with examples from a case study on the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. We also explore the model's implications for existing IT alignment models, providing alternative theoretical explanations for how IT alignment creates value.},

Current methods tend to be based on lifecycle principles and so are project management tools. Additionally, project management is learnt by a process of ‘coming up through the ranks’. Modern methods of structured analysis and design, computer aided coding and the move towards prototyping cause one to question whether or not the current management style, the support tools and training methods are going to be appropriate for tomorrow's technology. This paper proposes an alternative model of management and examines it to see whether or not it is better suited to modern methods, to being computer aided and to training the next generation of project managers.},

@article{RichardsonWeill1999a,
 abstract = {Telstra – until recently Australia's only telecommunications carrier – is internationally recognized within the industry for providing a world-class telecommunications service to a highly dispersed and isolated population under challenging environmental conditions. In 1990, the Australian Government announced that it would end Telstra's monopoly and move towards a deregulated telecommunications industry. The first step was a competitive duopoly and, in 1991–1992, a private carrier – Optus Communications – became Telstra's first competitor in the Australian market-place. On 1 July 1997 the industry was fully deregulated. Over this period, Telstra has undergone enormous changes – none of which is more dramatic than the shift from an engineering-driven organization, to one with a marketing focus. The shift in emphasis from engineering to marketing is clearly reflected by the establishment of Telstra's National Telemarketing Centre (NTC). Though originally created in response to deregulation and the threat of its first competitor, the NTC has grown to become a major national marketing channel for Telstra, as well as providing national customer and product support services. This case examines the function of the NTC within Telstra, the role of technology at the NTC and the way call centres affect organizational flexibility and change the relationship between Telstra and its customers.},

 abstract = {ICT-enabled virtual organisations (VOs) are regarded as the appropriate organisational response to turbulent markets. Although much has been written about the structural characteristics and propositions of VOs, their inherent limitations and structural shortcomings remain largely unaddressed. Based on the structural properties of VOs, most frequently discussed in the literature, we introduce the V-form organisation as an ideal type of VOs. A conceptual analysis, however, reveals a mismatch between espoused benefits of the ideal type and preconditions in terms of collaborative practices needed to succeed in a turbulent environment. Dealing with complex tasks in a collaborative environment requires shared understanding, shared values and a level of social cohesion, which do not simply emerge in a virtual setting. Social capital theory addresses the social and cultural preconditions of collaboration. Our analysis shows preconditions for successful value creation in VOs and suggests management measures to foster and facilitate environments for the development of social capital.},

Freedom of speech on social media has thus become a matter of concern, with calls for better regulation. Public debate revolves around content moderation, seen by some as necessary to remove harmful content, yet as censorship by others. In this article, we argue that the current debate is exclusively focused on the speaking side of speech but overlooks an important way in which platforms have come to interfere with free speech on the audience side. Rather than simply speaking to one’s follower network, algorithms now organise speech on social media with the aim to increase user engagement and marketability for targeted advertising.

We put forward algorithmic audiencing as a discovery, a novel phenomenon that has been overlooked so far. We show that it interferes with free speech in unprecedented ways not possible in pre-digital times, by amplifying or suppressing speech for economic gain, which in turn distorts the free and fair exchange of ideas in public discourse. When black-boxed algorithms determine who we speak to the problematic for free speech changes from ‘what can be said’ to ‘what will be heard’ and ‘by whom’. We must urgently problematise the audience side of speech if we want to truly understand, and regulate, free speech on social media.

The social care sector is not yet a great user of information technology (IT) and the thinking about IS is generally less well-developed than, for instance, in the health care sector. Research in health informatics indicates that there are special problems in creating integrated solutions and achieving the uptake of systems. This project was therefore undertaken with the benefit of experience of previous projects in health and social services and in the expectation that attention to participative design and people factors would be the key determinants of success.

Its particular emphasis is on the need for early preparation, in advance of the student's arrival and then throughout the teaching process. It points to the type of support facilities required. Although all the main headings would need to be considered in the teaching of any subject to visually handicapped students there are several that have added importance in the teaching of information systems. The paper is an attempt to share experience rather than make a case for tackling the issues raised in one particular way.},

@article{Rode2016,
 abstract = {In order to foster knowledge-sharing among employees, an increasing number of companies has recently begun implementing social network-based enterprise social media platforms (ESMPs). Although employees are expected to adopt these platforms quickly and use them as actively as they use public and free social media, patterns of private and corporate usage differ. While some research on the determinants of using public and free social media like Facebook has been conducted, empirical studies on the factors determining active participation in ESMPs is scarce. Based on research derived from a survey of 492 respondents carried out in a large knowledge-intensive firm, this paper addresses this gap. The results of our empirical quantitative study reveal that extrinsic motivation in particular – that is, anticipated gains in reputation and reciprocal benefits – drives employees to share knowledge in ESMPs. Knowledge-sharing self-efficacy also facilitates participation, while the enjoyment in helping others does not. The study contributes to information systems and knowledge management research, as it reveals motivational factors that drive the individual adoption in terms of active use of ESMPs. Managerial implications are derived from these results.},

 abstract = {This article empirically investigates the process by which a digital infrastructure evolved and took the architectural form of a digital platform as a core–periphery structure over a 20-year period. Our study pays special attention to the developmental dependencies of the components of the infrastructure’s installed base and how the interdependencies between the platform core and periphery evolve over time. We use the notion of ‘generative entrenchment’ to provide an account of the formation and unfolding of a core–periphery structure from an evolving digital infrastructure that highlights three aspects of the process. First, the process of architectural evolution that our study depicts comprises three phases showing a gradual reversal of the entrenchment relationship of the platform core and periphery: (1) entrenchment of the periphery, (2) mutual entrenchment of the core and periphery, and (3) entrenchment of the core. Second, we show how the generatively entrenched infrastructure’s installed base shaped the decisions and choices regarding the initial platform core. Third, we identify three architectural practices (creating redundancy in the core, augmenting the core with novelty, and reducing the heterogeneity of an entrenched peripheral component and later integrating it into the core) that weakened the entrenchment of the peripheral components, amplified the role of the core, and consolidated the core–periphery structure.},

 abstract = {Although inter-organizational information systems (IOIS) implementation has been widely studied, mainstream literature has not focused on understanding how implementation unfolds and how the existing components of the installed base shape the process. This paper addresses this gap by conducting a socio-technical, process-oriented, and multilevel study. Based on a longitudinal in-depth case study of the implementation of an industry IOIS, we develop an explication of IOIS implementation that considers the role of the installed base. Using the lens of actor-network theory (ANT), we counter the mainstream IOIS literature by showing that IOIS implementation cannot only be explained by a fixed set of independent factors; instead, the dynamic mutual shaping of socio-technical actors throughout implementation complements existing factor-based models in explaining the evolution and the outcome (success or failure). The study also shows the importance of complying with the technical and non-technical components of the installed base for an IOIS to be successfully initiated.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we propose Grounded Design - a particular design research (DR) approach rooted in a practice-theoretical tradition. It assesses the quality of information technology (IT) design through evaluation of emerging changes in social practices, which result from the appropriation and use of IT artifacts. The paper starts with a systematic analysis of the reasons for persistent limitations of traditional information systems DR, specifically in coping with problems of contingency and self-referentiality. Following this critique, the principles of Grounded Design are presented. Grounded Design is applied in case studies where we reconstruct the social practices observed before and during the design and appropriation of innovative IT artifacts. We call these context-specific research endeavors ‘design case studies.’ In conducting these case studies, Grounded Design builds upon well-established research methods such as ethnographical field studies, participatory design and action research. To support the transferability of its situated findings, Grounded Design suggests documenting increasing numbers of design case studies to create an extended, comparative knowledge base. Comparing cases allows for the emergence of bottom-up concepts dealing with the design and appropriation of innovative IT artifacts in social practice.},

 abstract = {Knowledge transfer, communication, and shared understanding between project stakeholders are important factors in requirements development and in the information systems development process. Nevertheless, the impact and analysis of language and linguistic communication during requirements development is still an open issue. In our research, we claim that requirements development depends on the ability to deal with language and communication issues in practice and reach shared understanding of requirements. We propose the concept of language quality as a suitable means for analyzing the emergence of coherent and meaningful requirements. By applying the thereby developed dimensions of language quality to a real information systems development project, we are able to obtain practice-grounded propositions to further evaluate the consequences of different actions on the interaction and communication process of stakeholders in requirements development.},

 abstract = {This case study, which is divided into parts A and B, describes one firm's experiences as it adopted a process perspective to managing its business, examined the implications for its information systems needs, decided to acquire SAP (an integrated, enterprise-wide software package) and embarked on the SAP implementation. ‘Dow Corning Corporation part A: Rethinking the Role of IT Within the Firm’ focuses on the business context and describes the role and structure of the information technology (IT) function at Dow Corning in late 1994. In the midst of a legal crisis that was draining financial resources, the firm had to address global competition. The case poses the question of how IT should be organized and managed to meet current business challenges. ‘Dow Corning Corporation part B: Re-engineering Global Processes’ is set in March 1997. The IT organization had been redesigned and reported to a member of the senior management team. The case focuses on Dow Corning's pilot implementation of SAP and its plans to re-engineer global processes. Special attention is given to the IT unit's role in the re-engineering and systems implementation processes.},

 abstract = {This paper seeks to advance our understanding of the dynamics of persistence and change in information systems development. Towards this goal, it draws upon dialectical theory, which enables viewing persistence and change during IS development relative to the thesis operating at that time. This approach recognizes that the nature of the system itself often changes during the development process. This also allows simultaneous attention to persistence and change, combining persistence with certain elements of the thesis along with change in some other elements. Empirically based on three cases, the paper provides insights into the content and process elements of theses, governing the characteristics of the system and the nature of the development process, respectively. It offers one possible explanation for the evolution of the IS development process and some insights into the strategies for improving this process through greater attention to the theses and the dialectic processes.},

 abstract = {A systems development methodology is a collection of procedures, tools, and techniques to develop computer based information systems. To develop better information systems, research studies have suggested several requirements for these methodologies. These requirements may not be equally important for practitioners. Identification of their importance for practitioners can guide researchers to solve practical issues in systems development. It will also be useful to evaluate and compare various methodologies. A study in which theoretical requirements were presented to practitioners for evaluation is presented and its findings described.},

@article{Salmela2008,
 abstract = {Increased reliance on computers by many companies and public organisations has generated a business risk for them. For example, problems in systems availability can lead to additional cost in operations, lost revenues and competitive losses. Systematic analyses are needed to avoid such losses. Prior research provides rigorous methods for identifying information systems risks and reducing the likelihood of these risks. The analysis of potential business losses in the user organisations has, however, received only limited attention. The objective in this paper is to investigate methods that can be used in the systematic identification of potential losses in the user organisation. The paper provides a review of prior literature on methods that can be used to analyse and report such losses. One understudied method is business process analysis that entails a systematic analysis of potential losses in different phases of the organisation's core business processes. Action research was used to examine the use of business process analysis as a method to associate information systems availability risk with potential business losses. The analysis was carried out in two different companies, one operating in the paper industry and the other one in the finance sector. The study contributes to research by summarising prior research on the analysis of business losses and by illustrating how the use of one method, business process analysis, assisted the client organisations. Perhaps most importantly, it identifies a new topic that has received very little attention in information systems research, despite its obvious managerial and practical significance.},

 abstract = {This article considers why, despite forecasts to the contrary and in spite of being apparently well-suited to the technology, management accounting-based expert system developments appear to be virtually non-existent. The manner in which organizational change develops and the theoretical justification for the suitability of the management accounting domain for expert systems developments are reviewed, and a number of hypotheses are considered before describing and reporting the results of a survey into the attitudes and environment of UK practising management accountants. The findings suggest that management accountants may lack both awareness of the term and understanding of the nature of expert systems and that they generally do not believe that software can be trusted to make their job easier and improve the consistency of their decision making. It is concluded that a major educational initiative may be required if there is to be any likelihood of a significant change from the current position.},

 abstract = {This paper reports on the results from a survey of the provision of information technology (IT) course units in general MBA programmes in Australia. The results establish a baseline for future studies. They show widespread penetration of IT courses in general MBAs, but the amount and type of content they provide is only sufficient to give students a partial preparation for the general management task with respect to IT. There is an internal expectation gap between what IT academics view as core and the time and space available in the Master of Business Administration (MBA) curriculum. There is an external expectation gap between the issues currently of concern to business and the topics taught. At present the gap is widest in respect of business managers’ concerns about information infrastructure and organizational learning. The evidence suggests that neither expectation gap will decline over the next 5 years and may increase. We conclude that there is a need for increased provision in the curriculum. Recommendations are made for two core courses, with more attention to be given to topics of current concern to business managers.},

@article{Sayer1998a,
 abstract = {Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) as a methodology for organizational transformation has been around since the early 1990s. There are however, some serious issues of concern surrounding the success of BPR as a methodology for organizational change. This paper attempts to highlight the issues surrounding the BPR approach to change management that remain implicit within the re-engineering literature. The research presented in this paper specifically investigates BPR in practice and concentrates on the issues of power and control that underlie many of the re-engineering methodologies and how these conflict with the prerequisites of the flattened, empowered workforce that BPR envisions. The research presented here was conducted using the interpretive approach of ethnography to investigate how middle management were able to deny the technology of BPR and disable a change project. In order to maintain their hold on power in the organization they needed to revolt against the technology of re-engineering imposed on them by senior management. In using the clinical metaphor, middle management were able to create a reality around technology that portrayed it almost as a function of biological warfare, denying it being seen as a positive social tool. This paper highlights how they were able to manipulate the technology and turn its power around to reinforce their position and power in the process.},

@article{Scheepers2003,
 abstract = {Intranet technology has been rapidly adopted by many organizations. From being a largely unknown technology prior to the mid-1990s, numerous organizations today have implemented or are currently implementing intranets. The intranet implementation processes of three large organizations in two countries were studied over a period of 5 years. In particular, the paper investigates the role players who spearheaded the intranet implementations in these organizations. Five interrelated roles during the intranet implementation process are identified: the technology champion, organizational sponsor, intranet coordinator, intranet developer and content provider. In the light of the nature of intranet technology, each respective role is analysed in terms of its significance, key challenges and interrelationships during the implementation process. The paper further examines the dynamics of these roles in the aftermath of implementation as the technology becomes embedded in routine organizational activity.},

 abstract = {Over the past two decades, openness (e.g. ‘open’ innovation, ‘open’ education and ‘open’ strategy) has been of increasing interest for researchers and of increasing relevance to practitioners. Openness is often deeply embedded in information technology (IT) and can be both a driver for and a result of innovative IT. To clarify the concept of “openness”, we provide an overview of the scope of cross-disciplinary research on openness. Based on this overview, we develop a framework of openness, which proposes a higher-order concept of “openness” characterised by transparency, access, participation and democracy. The framework further distinguishes open resources, open processes and the effects of opening on particular domains. To provide the historical context and to appreciate the role of IT in openness, we discuss two historical examples of openness: the introduction of an open science model in academia (openness without IT) and the emergence of open source software development (openness with IT). We conclude by highlighting some concerns with and limitations of “openness”.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we examine the relation between social media use and the absorptive capacity of organisations. Over the past 10 years, many organisations have systematically adopted social media. Trade press and consulting companies often claim that the systematic use of social media increases the performance of organisations. However, such claims are typically neither empirically grounded nor theoretically examined. In this paper, based on key informant interviews at 20 organisations, we examine these claims empirically and theoretically. Firstly, we examine the ways in which social media are used by organisations. We identify five different social media use types that support different organisational purposes (broadcast, dialogue, collaboration, knowledge management and sociability). Secondly, we analyse how these five social media use types relate to organisations' absorptive capacity. We find that particular social media use types (e.g., dialogue) support organisations' absorptive capacity and, ultimately, their performance although others (e.g., sociability) do not.},

 abstract = {After 2 years of on-line experiments, Tom van Vianen, CEO, felt certain it was time to fully implement STATER NV's new ‘e-servicing’ concept with a cohesive strategy. Established in 1997 in The Netherlands and headquartered in Amersfoort, STATER had 27 business clients and serviced over 80 different mortgage portfolios of more than 450,000 mainly residential loans in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany. Their mortgage service operations and information systems were considered state-of-the-art in 2002, but they were moving business on-line while simultaneously increasing the types of services provided and expanding operations into Spain, France, and Italy — within the next five years. In a land known for taming the forces of the sea, Tom faced what seemed like a sea of ‘e-uncertainty.’ What exact roles should STATER play in an on-line loan market? How should they position themselves to lead in those roles? The E-Servicing Steering Committee looked to Tom to direct them, and he knew he needed a clear vision for the next Steering Committee meeting in 2 months, in May 2002.},

 abstract = {Cloud computing (CC) is an emerging form of IT outsourcing (ITO) that requires organizations to adjust their sourcing processes. Although ITO researchers have established an extensive knowledge base on the determinant factors that drive sourcing decisions from various theoretical perspectives, the majority of research on cloud-sourcing decisions focuses on technological aspects. We reviewed the CC and ITO literature and systematically coded the determinant factors that influence sourcing decisions. We show that most determinant factors of sourcing decisions in the ITO context remain valid for the CC context. However, the findings for some factors (i.e., asset specificity, client firm IT capabilities, client firm size, institutional influences, and uncertainty) are inconclusive for the CC and ITO contexts. We discuss how the peculiarities of CC can explain these inconclusive findings. Our results indicate that CC researchers should draw from research on ITO decision making but re-examine ITO concepts in the light of the peculiarities of CC, such as the differences between software and infrastructure services, the self-service procurement of cloud services, or the evolving role of IT departments. By summarizing determinant factors of cloud-sourcing decisions for consideration in future research, we contribute to the development of endogenous theories in the IS domain.},

To understand what capabilities are crucial to establish platform ecosystems and how they contribute to value co-creation and value capture, we conducted a multi-year, in-depth case study of SAP’s cloud platform project.

With our findings, we contribute to the discussion on how companies can overcome the challenging emergent phase of platform ecosystems. We thereby bridge literature on value creation in platform ecosystems and on organizational capabilities.

Given the extensive research on these technologies and the novelty of virtual worlds as a topic of study In Information systems (IS), It behooves us to learn from the concepts, theories and Insights generated primarily by other disciplines that have focused on these technologies. Because neither MUDs nor VR have significant organizational application, thus locating them outside of the IS discipline's purview, very little of this literature has found Its way Into IS research thus far. This article reviews the extant literature on virtual environments and seeks to make Its Insights accessible to IS research on virtual worlds. In particular, this will focus on concepts, theories and Insights regarding embodiment and presence, which are afforded by the avatar, a distinguishing technological artifact of virtual worlds.},

 abstract = {Virtual communities and social networks assume and consume more aspects of people's lives. In these evolving social spaces, the boundaries between actual and virtual reality, between living individuals and their virtual bodies, and between private and public domains are becoming ever more blurred. As a result, users and their presentations of self, as expressed through virtual bodies, are increasingly entangled. Consequently, more and more Internet users are cyborgs. For this reason, the ethical guidelines necessary for Internet research need to be revisited. We contend that the IS community has paid insufficient attention to the ethics of Internet research. To this end, we develop an understanding of issues related to online human subjects research by distinguishing between a disembodied and an entangled view of the Internet. We outline a framework to guide investigators and research ethics committees in answering a key question in the age of cyborgism: When does a proposed Internet study deal with human subjects as opposed to digital material?},

 abstract = {Research into the acceptance of technology is in need of an alternative approach. Despite repeated calls for research to guide our colleagues-in-practice in the deployment of systems that are accepted, there has yet to be systematic research into the relationship between the decisions made by individuals and the bottom-line impact that is derived from user acceptance. This study fills the gap in the literature by theorizing a process-based view of information technology (IT) acceptance. We report on a narrative study of 30 users of an ERP deployment and, analyzing this qualitative data through the lens of the five decisions of acceptance proposed by Schwarz and Chin, propose a process model of IT acceptance. We conclude by theorizing on the relationship between these structures and the corresponding bottom-line impacts.},

@article{SeddonScheepers2015,
 abstract = {This paper is a companion to the paper on generalization in IS research by Williams and Tsang published in this edition of the Journal of Information Technology. Its purpose is to discuss the implications of the robust exchange of views about the meaning of the term ‘generalization’ in four papers, two by Lee and Baskerville, and two by Tsang and Williams. The objectives of this paper are, first, to help the reader understand the issues by summarizing the arguments in the four papers, and second, to assess the implications of the debate for future IS research. Our conclusion is that when the papers are interpreted from the perspectives of the respective pairs of authors, most of what they say is sound. However, because their perspectives are so different, their differences of opinion are also very real. As a way of showing that neither pair of authors’ conception of generalization is the ‘last word’ on this topic, the paper also compares key concepts from both pairs of authors with those from Seddon and Scheepers. It is argued that although the Seddon and Scheepers’ framework is also not the ‘last word’, it may prove more useful than either of the two preceding frameworks.},

 abstract = {Prior research on digital ecosystems focuses on the focal firm (e.g., a platform owner) and its ecosystem governance. However, there is a dearth of literature examining the non-focal actor, that is, an ecosystem participant who is at the periphery of a digital ecosystem. This paper proposes a theoretical perspective of the non-focal firm's participation across digital ecosystems for cultivating its innovation habitat through capability search and redeem. Capability search involves the location of external capability deemed valuable for extending the firm's innovation habitat. Capability redeem refers to the firm's use of external capability to develop, distribute, and/or monetize its products and services. We generate and sensitize the proposed perspective in the context of Sony Ericsson's innovation habitat by interpreting the mobile device manufacturer's participation across four digital ecosystems (Visual Basic, Java, Digital Music, and Android). Our findings suggest that the non-focal actor cannot rely on a single ecosystem for addressing all relevant layers of innovation. It benefits from pursuing a pluralistic strategy, operating across digital ecosystems to avoid investing all efforts in the same ecosystem. The model of ecosystem capability search and redeem, which is a result of ideographic research explanation, extends current perspectives on digital ecosystems and contributes to the emerging literature in the digital age.},

The first part of the paper examines the history of database marketing and the development of two different approaches. In the first approach, the database is used tactically as a high quality mailing list. In the second approach, the database is used strategically, to re-engineer the sales and marketing process. The second part of the paper looks at the practical issues in implementing the strategic approach. Risk management rules are proposed to deal with these implementation problems, and sources of advice and assistance described.},

 abstract = {We investigate the concept of Smart Business Networks by using Beer's Viable System Model (VSM) to analyse how such a network mitigates the affect of emergent, and therefore unforecastable, demands upon the networked businesses. We examine the requirements for network smartness, highlight some significant properties of one Smart Network and use our case analysis and concepts from systems theory to suggest some general properties such as natural stability and distributed capability. We have found that smartness is distributed and shared behavioural process standards can act to stabilise complex systems. This is important because it mitigates emergent behaviour within increasingly complex business networks. The contributions of our article apply both to academics and business practitioners and are in its illustration and investigation of one Smart Business Network including how the smart capability functions at a strategic, business process and technical level; and the use of Beer's VSM to analyse an electricity market.},

@article{ShepherdCleggStride2009,
 abstract = {This paper presents a multi-method analysis of the implementation of an enterprise resource planning system. It argues the majority of research treats these systems as having essential technical properties that enable them to bring about positive organisational effects. In contrast, we adopt a post-essentialist perspective that understands discourse as constructing ERP systems, rather than reflecting their essential properties. Discourse analysis of interviews and focus groups was used to compare justifications for the implementation produced by members of the ERP project team with end users’ reactions to the system. In contrast to previous studies, this opens the ERP black box by illustrating how the capabilities of these systems, and their organisational effects, are constructed through language. Moreover, it demonstrates the important function these constructions perform in legitimising or undermining ERP implementation. Statistical analysis of post-implementation questionnaires identified the predictors of established measures of users’ reactions to IT systems. By comparing these data with end users’ discursive reactions to the project, we identify several constructs for inclusion in future studies of users’ reactions to ERP systems. The paper concludes by summarising the contributions and limitations of the study and its implications for future research and practice.},

@article{Siau1999a,
 abstract = {Xcert's business is in developing Internet and Intranet security enhancement technology. Xcert was founded in April 1996 by Andrew Csinger and Pat Richard and was headquartered in Vancouver, Canada. Xcert's solution to Internet security was a public key infrastructure (PKI). PKI is a system of digital certificates, certificate authorities (CAs) and other registration authorities that verify and authenticate the validity of each party involved in an Internet transaction. Xcert's PKI technology allows organizations of any size to issue digital certificates to their members. These organizations become their own CA and are empowered to issue digital certificates to their individual client base. This case study is about a start-up company that is in transition from a dream stage to a reality stage. One of the issues that surfaces in the case study is intraindustry competition. Despite being an early entrant into the Internet security business, Xcert faced brutal competition from companies such as Entrust, Nortel, VeriSign and Netscape. The problems facing the company include (1) finances, (2) future direction and leadership, (3) structure, experience and size and (4) marketing. This is a very rich case study with a number of interrelated issues. The case serves two teaching aims. Firstly, this case allows students to confront and discuss real-life issues facing a start-up information technology (IT) company. The students analysing the case are asked to provide alternatives and solutions to the problems by putting themselves in the positions of the founders of the company. Students should come to understand the difficulty in managing a start-up company and the various trade-offs the management needs to make. Secondly, the case study introduces various Internet security concepts to students.},

This paper argues that the pedagogical effectiveness of gaming simulations can be increased through the integration of an intelligent tutoring facility and examines possible roles for such support within a gaming simulation environment. It then commences to present INTUITION, the implementation of the Metal Box Business Simulation game, that illustrates how an intelligent tutoring facility may be integrated within a gaming simulation environment in order to increase its educational value.},

 abstract = {Financial market manipulations represent a major threat to trust and market integrity in capital markets. Manipulations contribute to mispricing, market imperfections and an increase in transaction costs for market participants and in costs of capital for issuers. Manipulations are facilitated by increased transaction velocity, speculative trading and abusive usage of new trading technologies, i.e., they are directly linked to financial sector changes that drive financialization. Research at the intersection of financialization and IS might support regulatory authorities and market operators in improving market surveillance and helping to detect fraudulent activities. However, confusing terminology is prevalent on financial markets with respect to different manipulation techniques and their characteristics, which hampers efficient fraud detection. Furthermore, recognizing manipulations is challenging given the large number of information sources and the vast number of trades occurring not least because of high-frequency traders. Therefore, automated market surveillance tools require a comprehensive taxonomy of financial market manipulations as a basis for appropriate configuration. Based on a cluster analysis of SEC litigation releases, a review of the latest market abuse regulation and academic studies, we develop a taxonomy of manipulations that structures and details existing manipulation techniques and reveals how these techniques differ along several dimensions. In a case study, we show how the taxonomy can be utilized to guide the development of appropriate decision support systems for fraud detection.},

 abstract = {This paper analyses the situation and suggests a way ahead. It is in three parts. The first part reviews the situation at the start of the 1990s. It identifies the growing concern of managers about justifying IT investment, and the methods which they currently use in their organizations to do so. The second part discusses the challenge facing managers, at the general level and in the field of Information Management. A major challenge is for IT/IS to be viewed within the context of strategic business thinking, the principles of which are described in this section. The third part of the paper outlines the response of managers and IT professionals in this area in the 1990s. A benefit-level matrix is described which can be used as a tool for both analysis and synthesis within the business context. Finally, there is some practical guidance about managing benefits alongside other aspects of IT projects.},

After a theoretical introduction, we introduce the firm (Editorial Aranzadi) and study some of the factors that provoked the beginning of the innovation process in the late 1980s. Then we analyse the main phases of the process of introduction of IT and organizational change in Editorial Aranzadi. Attention is then focused on product and process innovation.

Information and communication technologies form joint sociotechnical systems where new practices emerge. The paper focuses on describing the academic background of the gifting framework to help develop a deeper, theory-based, understanding of these sociotechnical phenomena. Three themes are prevalent In the gifting literature: other- orientation, social bonding and generalized reciprocity. The paper gives examples of how these themes are enacted by end-users via the use of Information and communication technologies. Finally, sociotechnically embedded economies, called gifting technologies, are Identified and discussed.},

 abstract = {This paper employs the network perspective to study patterns and structures of intra- organizational learning networks. The theoretical background draws from cognitive theories, theories of homophily and proximity, theories of social exchange, the theory of generalized exchange, small-worlds theory, and social process theory. The levels of analysis applied are actor, dyadic, triadic, and global. Confirmatory social network analysis (exponential random graph modeling) was employed for data analysis. Findings suggest: (1) central actors in the learning network are experienced and hold senior positions in the organizational hierarchy; (2) evidence of homophlly (In terms of gender, tenure, and hierarchical level relations) and proximity (In terms of geographical and departmental distances) in learning relationships; (3) learning relationships are non-reciprocal; and (4) transitivity and high local clustering with sparse inter-cluster ties are significant for intra-organizational learning networks.},

@article{Smith1990c,
 abstract = {This paper urges greater recognition of the case study as a research method for information management. It acknowledges concern about the representatives of case studies but by specifying the relationships between epistemology and research methods shows that this concern is misplaced. Representatives is irrelevant for many research purposes, particularly when the distinction is made between logical and statistical inference. The validity of explanations or theory derived from case studies depends on the logic of the analysis and acknowledgement of ceteris paribus conditions, not on how typical the cases may be. Typologies of case studies have been proposed and these are considered, together with recommendations for the conduct of systematic and rigorous case study research. It is stressed that research problems should be addressed using appropriate research methods. Research of the important problems within the management area frequently demands a qualitative research approach, though it would seem that such an approach is often ignored because of a positivist research orientation. An assessment of the strengths and weakness of the case study method, which highlights its potential in the vital role of theory-building, leads to the conclusions that this method has much to commend it to information management researchers (1).},

 abstract = {With increasing cost-reduction pressures, outsourcing – selectively turning over some information systems functions and processing services to a subcontractor – has emerged in the last few years as an important option for chief information officers (CIOs). In this paper we present the results of our exploratory, empirical research into the practices and views of IS outsourcing. The research methodology of a questionnaire-based mail survey was used. The survey sample consisted of companies that were identified as the most effective users of IS by Computerworld magazine. The paper provides empirical evidence on the extent to which outsourcing of various IS functions is being practised, and the views of CIOs concerning the advantages, disadvantages and motives of IS outsourcing. The paper also sheds light on the relationship between various firm characteristics and IS outsourcing, and investigates the economics of, and decision-making processes in, IS outsourcing. There is a special focus on the comparison of USA-based and global IS outsourcing.},

Significantly this research addressed the following questions: How well organizations matched their IT investment plans with their strategic planning; how well IT strategies were formulated; how well IT systems were implemented and what were the critical success factors and impediments; and whether organizations were truly getting value from their IT investment. The findings have shown the causes of misused IT in some organizations, such as IT strategy not closely aligned with business strategy, no change of historical IT structure, lack of understanding of the potential of IT, lack of CEO and senior management support and awareness of IT's potential, impediments to IT development and implementation. Although in many organizations the role of IT development has become proactive and strategic to gain competitive advantage through primary and support activities, it has still not unleashed ITs full potential.},

 abstract = {While substantial research has examined the control of Information systems (IS) projects, most studies In this area have only examined how one controller manages a single group of controllees. However, many IS projects, especially enterprise systems projects (often initiated by an organization's corporate headquarters, and involving business unit users and consultants), have multiple stakeholders. The corporate headquarters (the project's principal controller) must simultaneously ensure that the various stakeholders are aligned with the project's goals despite their diverse motivations, and that the stakeholders collaborate with each other to achieve project success. Behavior control theory argues that the controller enacts a control portfolio of formal and Informal controls. However, the presence of multiple controllee groups increases the complexity of vertical controller- controllee relationships, the salience of controllee-controllee relationships, and the interaction between these vertical and horizontal relationships. We therefore examined the creation and evolution of the control portfolio In a multi-stakeholder project over a period of 14 months. We found that (1) the principal controller did enact separate controls for the user and consultant groups; (2) there was more than one controller - the principal controller co-existed with subordinate controllers; and (3) controls enacted by the subordinate controllers and other controllees that cut across stakeholder groups required the support of the principal controller.},

 abstract = {Technology-mediated learning (TML) is a major trend in education, since it allows to integrate the strengths of traditional- and IT-based learning activities. However, TML providers still struggle in identifying areas for improvement in their TML offerings. One reason for their struggles is inconsistencies in the literature regarding drivers of TML performance. Prior research suggests that these inconsistencies in TML literature might stem from neglecting the importance of considering the process perspective in addition to the input and outcome perspectives. This gap needs to be addressed to better understand the different drivers of the performance of TML scenarios. Filling this gap would further support TML providers with more precise guidance on how to (re-)design their offerings toward their customers’ needs. To achieve our goal, we combine qualitative and quantitative methods to develop and evaluate a holistic model for assessing TML performance. In particular, we consolidate the body of literature, followed by a focus group workshop and a Q-sorting exercise with TML practitioners, and an empirical pre-study to develop and initially test our research model. Afterward, we collect data from 161 participants of TML vocational software trainings and evaluate our holistic model for assessing TML performance. The results provide empirical evidence for the importance of the TML process quality dimension as suggested in prior literature and highlighted by our TML practitioners. Our main theoretical as well as practical contribution is a holistic model that provides comprehensive insights into which constructs and facets shape the performance of TML in vocational software trainings.},

 abstract = {How can we use synergy to explain the value created by business analytics systems? In this article, we conceptualize and operationalize two important aspects of synergy: namely, the synergistic relationship and the synergistic outcome. We explore the enablers and mechanisms that are involved in a synergistic relationship between business analytics systems and customer relationship management systems and define it as the ability of systems to work together, span their boundaries and complement each other. Synergistic outcomes are the new business analytics–enabled customer relationship management systems that emerge from the synergistic relationship between business analytics systems and customer relationship management systems. Taking a whole system perspective, business analytics–enabled customer relationship management systems comprise the components and the emergent properties that arise from their interaction (e.g. the ability to cross-sell and up-sell based on advanced computational methods), in which the emergent properties are new because they do not exist in the individual components. We develop a research model that uses Synergistic Relationship and Synergistic Outcomes to explain the business value created by business analytics systems and customer relationship management systems, and we test this model using a survey of 201 managers in Australia and the United States. We find that the synergistic relationship plays a significant role in the creation of business analytics–enabled customer relationship management systems and subsequently business value. Business analytics–enabled customer relationship management systems—comprising business analytics systems, customer relationship management systems and their emergent properties—contribute to transactional, informational and strategic value. This goes beyond the value created by the business analytics and customer relationship management systems individually, as measured through statistical interaction.},

 abstract = {Academics and business professionals are currently showing a significant interest in understanding the management of knowledge and the roles to be played therein by information and communication technology (ICT). This paper takes a closer look at one of the primary issues raised when supporting the management of knowledge: how to understand the role of knowledge classification and codification as means for further organizational learning and innovation. Two manufacturing cases are analysed using particular perspectives from current theories on classification, namely the management of knowledge and organizational innovation. It is concluded that a more complex understanding of the interplay between cognitive and community models for knowledge management as informed by research on the social processes of classification can inform our understanding of both the role of classification of knowledge for organizational innovation and the viability of providing ICT support based on codified knowledge.},

 abstract = {This research proposes and validates a design theory for digital platforms that support online communities (DPsOC). It addresses ways in which digital platforms can effectively support social interactions in online communities. Drawing upon prior literature on IS design theory, online communities, and platforms, we derive an initial set of propositions for designing effective DPsOC. Our overarching proposition is that three components of digital platform architecture (core, interface, and complements) should collectively support the mix of the three distinct types of social interaction structures of online community (information sharing, collaboration, and collective action). We validate the initial propositions and generate additional insights by conducting an in-depth analysis of an European digital platform for elderly care assistance. We further validate the propositions by analyzing three widely used digital platforms, including Twitter, Wikipedia, and Liquidfeedback, and we derive additional propositions and insights that can guide DPsOC design. We discuss the implications of this research for research and practice.},

These problems are due largely to insufficient methodological foresight in system design. In particular, reduction of a system into components and the explicit representation of knowledge (frames, rules etc) are misused. Research has begun at OZIR to investigate a different class of system: integral and implicitly intelligent. This paper explains the hypotheses involved and the direction of research.},

After exploring multiple ‘technological options,’ the Indian Railways decided to undertake a pilot project based on time-tested Automatic Equipment Identification system using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. However, a number of other technological options are now available, which include EPC Gen2-based RFID systems, Global Positioning System solutions, Optical Character Recognition (OCR)-based systems, and manual hand-held data collection devices integrated with the current Freight Operations System. Each of these systems has its own advantages and limitations. Although Indian Railways officials are going ahead with the pilot project, they are uncertain as to the appropriate technological choice, given the wide range of available technology options. Further, they are faced with competing interests from different stakeholder groups (departments), who favor different technologies.},

@article{SteinfieldCabyVialle1992a,
 abstract = {Business applications represent one of the fastest growing areas for videotex. Due to the efforts to link national videotex systems, we analyse the potential uses and effects of videotex for international business applications. Using case studies of international videotex use by eight firms, we outline the key strategies firms use to exploit videotex internationally, as well as the major impacts of this use. Main strategies include: (1) adding value to basic transactions through the incremental addition of new services, (2) using the basic service as a product leader that draws customers into a relationship, (3) using the information byproducts of transactions to better manage relationships with system users and (4) linking videotex systems with other networks and information systems as a means of broadening reach. Impacts centered primarily on the ways firms related to their customers and suppliers including a shifting of costs of transactions away from the service provider, a more easily expanded base of partners and more standardized interactions with these. International connections via videotex helped to alleviate the high costs of international telecommunications, and in some cases, permitted companies to access foreign markets previously too expensive to reach. Theoretically, the case studies illustrate the use of telematic systems to enable marketing strategies that have characteristics of both market and hierarchy approaches as noted by Williamson (1975), and both cost/volume and product differentiation strategies pointed out by Porter (1980). Regarding international strategy, the case studies further illustrate that such telematic applications can help firms achieve the benefits of both global and multidomestic approaches discussed by Porter (1986).},

Much can be learned at the industry-level of analysis that might not be revealed in studies conducted at the organizational level of analysis. This article summarizes a case study of one industry - the US home mortgage industry - in order to illustrate three types of industry-level phenomena that surface when examining use of interorganizational IT-driven coordination systems: collective actions among industry participants, performance effects, and structural effects. Our discussion of case results distinguishes between industry outcomes that are the net result of the accumulation of organizational actions vs. outcomes where industry-level consequences are qualitatively different from what is observed at the organizational level.},

 abstract = {Despite the ubiquitous presence of information technology (IT) in the workplace and the continued computerization of all kinds of work practices, investigations into how IT artifacts play a role in professional identity construction remain rare. Existing studies tend to emphasize sense-making and discourses around IT. This study attempts to fill some of this gap by offering an empirical investigation of how IT artifacts play a role in professional identity enactment at a back office of a Big 4 accounting firm. Building on the socio-technical school of thought and the concept of self as storied, the paper offers a complementary perspective to existing views on the role of IT in identity formation. Our findings reveal that IT artifacts become part of professional identity performances by acting as landmarks in individuals’ self-narratives around which the self and others are positioned and a preferred professional identity is enacted. The findings also indicate that different types of preferred selves may be expressed in specific patterns of technology use. As such, our study contributes to a better understanding of professional identity construction, workplace behavior and ongoing use or non-use of IT at work.},

 abstract = {Electronic commerce (e-commerce) can occur between a business and its customers, as well as between a business and its suppliers. To facilitate interorganizational e-commerce it is often necessary to share supply and demand information between supply chain partners. Based on our analysis of supply chains in several industries we identify the mechanisms (business processes) required for effective supply chain management. We also identify the information system components needed to support these mechanisms, show how the individual components can be integrated into an information infrastructure framework and identify some technologies currently available that can fit within our proposed infrastructure. We illustrate the usefulness of our framework by simulating convergent assembly (commonly associated with motor vehicle and aerospace production) supply chain performance under various information-sharing strategies supported by our proposed infrastructure. We find that inventory costs can be reduced while maintaining acceptable order fulfilment cycle times. This is true because information, which provides the basis for enhanced coordination and reduced uncertainty, can substitute for inventory.},

 abstract = {This case is intended to serve as the basis for one or two sessions of an introductory Information Technology course at an MBA program or for one session at a senior executive program. The aim is to address what needs to be known by general managers in terms of technology and at the same time serve as an introduction for those who want to deepen their knowledge in business-to-business (B2B) technologies. Thus, it is intended to cover basic technology principles and concepts essential for any CEO/MBA. It also covers key business concepts that are impacted by information technology such as industry convergence and B2B. The approach we suggest be taken with this case is an integrative one where both technology and business concepts are intermingled throughout the class discussion. An essential ingredient of this approach is to provide a business rational for why technology matters - using this case in the first session before drilling-down into the more specific technology details of XML and metadata in a possible second session. We have worked on other cases to extend this approach to a full-scale introductory MBA/senior executive class. There are two unique features of this approach. First, it is neither technology centric nor business centric. Instead, it links executive decisions with solid information technology fundamentals. Second, our approach would be concise not requiring more than 200 pages of core case material for a full 25-session course. We believe this is an important feature because MBA-style audience base does not go into a CIO career path most of the times and will therefore not be able to afford the amount of time a longer approach would require.},

 abstract = {In this paper, I contend that executive leaders can and should be prepared to spot timely opportunities and prevent major failures, even if it requires understanding IT technical details. An essential part of executive leadership is exception management - and exceptions occur everywhere, often surfacing first as details, nothing more. Here I present two cases that show technology is no exception. In this paper, I outline how Steelscreen.com 's and RoweCom's early years can illustrate why understanding IT technical details helps explain IT-related failures and successes. In particular, I outline the differences between the two stories and argue that the show stopper for Steelscreen was at its crux a technology detail - the other shortcomings could have been addressed elsewhere. I conclude with some recommendations for executive leaders and a brief outline of a teaching approach suggestion for an MBA or a Senior Executive IT class based on the ideas presented.},

 abstract = {This paper analyses how transactions related to the exchange of goods and services are being performed on the Internet. The adoption of electronic markets in an industry has a disintermediation potential because it can create a direct link between the producer and the consumer (without the need for the intermediation role of distributors). Electronic markets lower the searches cost allowing customers to choose between more providers. This ultimately reduces both the costs for the customer and the profits for the producer. In this paper it is contended that electronic markets on the Internet have the opposite effect, resulting in an increase in intermediators. It introduces transaction streams which model how transactions are being conducted and helps explain the types of new intermediators that are appearing on the Internet. The mechanisms by which companies are exploring ways of extending transaction streams are also described. To illustrate the model, the paper briefly analyses transaction streams in the insurance industry and provides examples related to confidence in electronic commerce.},

 abstract = {Client/server computing is quickly becoming the computing architecture of choice in the 1990s. However, like many advances in information technology, public sources, such as trade journals and newspapers, portray client/server as a completely new paradigm which will transform our profession. But is it? We are conducting multiple case studies on organizations that have adopted client/server technology in order to extract managerial prescriptions for best practices in evaluating, developing and implementing effective client/server systems. Thus far, we have completed three case studies. Many of the lessons we are uncovering – the need for top management support, redesigning business processes before automation, user participation, phased implementation strategies and buying-in vendor skills to transfer learning – have been identified by previous researchers in other information technology contexts. Thus, although client/server is being touted as a radical change in information technology, practitioners need not discard the lessons from the past. Although there are some unique technical skills required to deploy client/server systems effectively, confirming project management lessons from the past is consoling to practitioners and academics alike. While the context of information technology changes rapidly, the organizational, administrative and policy practices are proving robust.},

Some of the unique challenges in managing enterprise-wide projects which were highlighted through the findings included the challenge of re-engineering business processes to ‘fit’ the process which the ERP software supports, investment in recruiting and reskilling technology professionals, the challenge of using external consultants and integrating their application-specific knowledge and technical expertise with existing teams, the risk of technological bottlenecks through client-server implementation and the challenge of recruiting and retaining business analysts who combine technology and business skills.},

 abstract = {When firms move to adopt and implement a popular IT innovation, what knowledge must they have or gain, in order to be successful? Here we offer a model that explains a firm's success in terms of its adoption know-why and know-when and its implementation know-how. We examine this model in an exploratory survey of some 118 firms’ adoption and implementation of packaged business software in the 1990s. Using multivariate methods, we identify business coordination as know-why and management understanding and vendor support as know-how factors important to success, explaining nearly 60% of the variance. There is limited evidence that the right adoption know-why may help in acquiring or fostering the right implementation know-how. The findings serve to remind practitioners that they should attend carefully to adoption rationales, grounded in business benefits, when they innovate with new IT.},

@article{Symons1990a,
 abstract = {Information systems (IS) are centrally important to the modern form of organization, but their impacts are not yet well understood. IS development is, in general, grounded in a quasi-scientific ‘formal-rationalism’, oriented chiefly towards technical aspects; yet the accompanying difficulties in implementation are due for the most part to ‘people problems’. In defining an IS as a computer system embedded in an organization, this paper argues that information systems are not purely technical systems, but also social systems. Consequently, work in this area necessitates an interactionist approach, taking the effects of information technology to be a product of neither the technical nor social aspects alone, but of their interaction. Evaluation is shaped, similarly, by the interaction of technique with social process: it is a multi-stage activity running through IS development. The history of IS development in the Processing Company illustrates these views and highlights the dysfunctionality of the formal-rational perspective.},

@article{Tan1995a,
 abstract = {In a study involving 88 companies., the nature of the linkages between business strategy and information technology (IT) responsiveness was explored. The results indicate that variations in IT–strategy responsiveness, measured by the extent to which IT is explicitly considered in business strategy formulation, are linked to the type of business strategy being pursued by the organization. For example, IT is more responsive to business strategy in organizations which place heavy emphasis on innovation in their product and market strategies than in those which operate in a relatively stable product/market area. This implies that organizations with an aggressive business strategy are more likely than those with a conservative business strategy to explicitly consider IT as a strategic resource in formulating business strategy. This paper suggests that the extent to which IT is used to shape business strategy differs among organizations, and that business strategy can help us understand these differences.},

 abstract = {Innovations in products and processes enabled by ICT such as mobile phones and the Internet constitute a rapidly emerging means of market development at the Bottom of the Pyramid (BOP), which consists of people who earn less than US$2 a day. However, these ICT-enabled market development efforts have not always yielded positive developmental outcomes, in part because market development is hindered by remote location and geographic dispersion of BOP communities, their low and uncertain incomes, and informal local markets having exploitative intermediaries. These conditions imply that BOP consumers and producers are ‘separated’ from marketers and customers, respectively, through physical distance, lack of financial ability, and information asymmetry. The paper examines the question: How do ICT innovations in products and processes impact development at the BOP? Drawing perspectives from the information systems (IS) and marketing literatures, we analyze how and why ICT-enabled innovations in products and processes deployed for market development at the BOP, enable developmental outcomes through reduction of market separations. Analyzing qualitative data gathered from interviews with 33 respondents in India, including BOP individuals, social entrepreneurs, and managers from private organizations, we find that ICT-enabled product and process innovations do have the potential to reduce four types of separations that ‘disconnect’ BOP consumers (producers) from marketers (customers). However, situated social conditions influence the impact of ICT innovations on reduction of separations. The reduction of separations leads to developmental outcomes at the BOP. Implications of our findings for theory, practice, and policy are discussed.},

@article{TateVernerHayward1989a,
 abstract = {From a CASE point of view business applications can be divided into three broad classes depending on their generality: those requiring general workbenches, those requiring specifically tailored workbenches, and those that could use blueprints. A CASE environment for all seasons is not what many business users really need. They would prefer an environment tailored to the specific class of application under development, one that will bring that application into being most efficiently and effectively, and keep it in vigorous operation over its lifetime. We have therefore concentrated on one particular application class of interest to the business community, namely interactive, data-centred systems. A model for the application class of interest is presented. The main CASE environment requirements identified, which should be integrated through a common project database and tailored to the characteristics of the application class, include business profile, semantic data model, state transition control model, system dictionary active during development, inheritable and tailorable objects such as reports, transactions and other user interactions, procedural facilities, configuration control, project control including costing and scheduling, and interfaces to decision support systems. It is noted that development and production have quite different characteristics and require separate environments. The need for flexibility and adaptability in some CASE environment areas, such as effort estimation and project control, is recognized and it is suggested that existing rule-based techniques should be used. Limitation of a CASE tool set to a rather narrow but common application class should result in substantial productivity gains.},

 abstract = {Studies have shown that maintenance is up to 80% of the life-cycle effort of developing and maintaining a business information technology (IT) system. There are several factors which significantly affect maintenance work. This paper concentrates on one of these factors which is the knowledge staff require for effective and efficient systems maintenance. The knowledge required is split into two categories. Firstly, there is the knowledge of the business environment within which an IT system operates. Secondly, there is the knowledge of the technical IT system, particularly the details of the software structure. It is argued that both categories of knowledge are equally important and difficult to acquire. Examples of techniques for improving this knowledge are discussed. The article is partly based on case-study research into the actual practice of systems development and maintenance in 31 UK IT departments.},

Using both theories and an infrastructural view of Information Technology service, we present a conceptual model of vendor sourcing decisions. We then present a number of propositions based on case studies of vendor decisions. Finally we conclude by discussing the theoretical contribution of RBV and TCE and, crucially, the value of combining both theories for the study of Netsourcing, and for other areas of IS research.},

 abstract = {Robotic process automation (RPA) is often used in organisational digitalisation efforts to automate work processes. RPA, and the software robots at its heart, is an equivocal and contentious technology. Adopting the products of theorising approach, this study views metaphors as central sensemaking and sensegiving devices that shape the interpretation of RPA among stakeholders towards a preferred reality of ways of seeing and experiencing software robots. The empirical materials are drawn from research in three Australasian organisations that have implemented RPA. Grounding our analysis in the domains-interaction model, we identified three root metaphors: person, robot and tool, their constitutive conceptual metaphors, and intended use as heuristics devices. Our findings show that metaphor is a powerful device that employees rely on to make sense of their experiences with a new digital technology that can potentially shape their roles, work practices and job design. In addition, managers and automation team members intentionally leverage metaphors to shape others’ perceptions of a software robot’s capabilities and limitations, its implication for human work and its expanding benefits for organisations over time, among others. Metaphor as a precursor to more formal theory provides scholars with a vocabulary to understand disparate experiences with an emergent automation technology that can be further developed to generate a theory of seeing automation and working with automated agents.},

@article{ThrelkelKavan1999a,
 abstract = {Traditional EDI/VAN technology has been used for almost three decades and has brought its users significant advantages resulting in increased productivity and efficiency. However, implementation constraints have restricted the technology to predominantly large corporations, thus limiting EDI's reach to a broader base of small suppliers and customers. Internet-based EDI, with significantly fewer implementation constraints, can play an important role in extending EDI benefits to a wider spectrum of businesses. Recently published articles reflect a reluctance on the part of traditional EDI users to adopt this new communication modality. The reasons for this reluctance include the newness of the Internet technology, potential Internet legislation and lack of Internet standards plus the reliability and security of data transmission within the Internet environment. This paper examines these management issues and describes existing and potential solutions available to both new and traditional EDI users. Since few companies have embraced Internet-based EDI, this paper concludes with some successful Internet EDI-based cases. Along with these cases, the authors present a very broad description of the nature of the products and services currently available in the market today to support Internet-based EDI.},

 abstract = {Most software firms struggle to take advantage of the potential benefits of software process improvement (SPI) as they adopt this technology into the complex and dynamic realities of their day-to-day operation. Such efforts are therefore typically fluctuating between management's attempt to control SPI technology adoption and events that causes the process to drift in unpredictable directions. To further understand how management's attempt to control the process is complemented by drifting, this article investigates the role of improvisation in adoption of SPI technology in a Danish software firm, SmallSoft, over a 10-year period (1996–2005). We found that micro-level and macro-level improvisations interacted, often in uncoordinated ways, to shape SPI technology adoption at SmallSoft. The improvisations enhanced employee creativity, motivation and empowerment, created momentum in the adoption process despite constrained resources, and, most importantly, helped adapt SPI technology to the everyday practices at SmallSoft. However, we also identified un-called for improvisations and outcomes that were uncoordinated with SmallSoft's goals. Based on these findings we discuss how management in small software firms can exploit improvisations to facilitate adoption of complex technologies like SPI.},

 abstract = {The advent of social networking websites presents further opportunities for criminals to obtain information for use in identity theft, cyber-stalking, and worse activities. This paper presents research investigating why users of social networking websites willingly disclose personal information and what sorts of information they provide (or not). The study employed an ethnographic approach of participation in the online community and interviews of community members, combined with a quantitative survey. The findings show that users are often simply not aware of the issues or feel that the risk to them personally is very low. The paper develops a preliminary theoretical model to explain the information disclosure phenomenon. It further recommends that government agencies or social networking websites themselves conduct campaigns to inform the public of these issues and that social networking websites consider removing some facilities. The study was conducted in an Australian context and focussed on the popular Facebook website.},

By tracing the progress of two first movers – the United States and the United Kingdom – the technological, industrial and economic pressures for change can be observed. In this paper we present the underlying assumptions, effects and expected benefits of the competitive paradigm. We argue, however, that the outcomes experienced by early adopters of this paradigm may not be the same for later entrants. Evidence from other industries, economic development theory, and social equity literature questions the assumption that all nations should progress along identical telecommunications policy paths.},

We conducted a comprehensive review of this literature and identified a rich set of voluntariness concepts and methods of operationalization. However, while considerable empirical evidence is reported in the literature, our review also revealed inconsistent results concerning the relationship between voluntariness and other concepts. Against that backdrop, we synthesized the literature into three types of voluntariness - perceived, intended and realizable voluntariness (RVOL), and showed how prior literature had not adequately accounted for RVOL. Moreover, we examined the multiple mechanisms that influence voluntariness and created a model to describe how to advance new knowledge about the important relationships among the three types of voluntariness and between voluntariness and user behavior. We argue that these concepts and relationships may help advance our knowledge of how a new technology is used individually and collectively in organizations.},

We argue that In order for digital business to develop among entrepreneurs In the EU and within different industry sectors and geographical locations, trust and regulation are of critical Importance. The article assesses the importance of this argument and focuses on the Interplay of regulatory and trust-based issues that need to be accommodated before one can expect SMEs to engage in e-business supported within a DBE environment. It then presents a taxonomy that addresses key regulatory issues and fosters trust. The article proposes the taxonomy as the vehicle for the simplification of a bewildering array of laws, standards, norms and expectations, as well as for the elimination of regulatory overlap and conflict. The contribution of the taxonomy is demonstrated in the last section of the article, where it is empirically tested and applied to SMEs which participated In the EU-funded DBE project.},

 abstract = {Information technology has an increasing impact in the development of rural areas but the development and implementation of telematic services in these areas present special problems such as the appropriate mix of communication technologies, the commercial prospects of recovering the cost of investment, the social problems etc., which currently limit their effective use. With the recent introduction of narrowband ISDN (Integrated Services Data Networks) in Europe it is now possible to offer various services on a single subscriber line. In addition, with the development of both high reliable fibre-optic transmission and very fast switching systems, the introduction of broadband ISDN can also be considered. Unfortunately, the less favoured regions of EC (European Community) lack infrastructure. The development in these areas will be a gradual process. Large investments will be required, and the systems installed will have a lifetime of some decades. Therefore the right decisions on the chosen technologies and on the appropriate system configurations have to be taken to ensure success. In this work, the teleworking prospects as an IT tool for rural development are studied in detail. The motivation, the technology and the prosperity of teleworking in the less favoured regions of the EC are analysed and discussed. The analysis considers the existing telecommunication infrastructure in each one of the six peripheral member states in relation with the development and implementation of some important telematic systems in these areas. The main features of the proposed technologies as well as the establishment of the possible cost effective strategies for IBC (Integrated Broadband Communication) implementation in rural areas is also provided. It appears that teleworking is a key element for rural development and can be implemented through the realization of the IBCNs (IBC Networks). By taking lessons from some of the most important experimental initiatives which have already been introduced in some countries, useful recommendations in the policy to be adopted by the EC are drawn and presented.},

Service delivery may include a complex mix of information technology and telecommunication providers, global networks and customers’ information technology devices.

When information technology-based service degradation occurs in a modern service, the information technology problem may originate from the service provider, another partner or any information technology equipment involved. But the customer may not be able to pinpoint the source of the problem immediately. We argue that existing research can only partially explain customers’ behavior following information technology-based service degradation; current research cannot account for the way in which information technology characteristics in information technology-based service degradation influence customers’ decisions to continue using or rejecting the service. To fulfill this gap, we interviewed information technology-based services’ customers. Our interviews suggest that the reasons affecting customers’ behavior may change and have differing importance during the information technology-based service degradation experience. We theorized the information technology-based service degradation experience into five stages: blaming, bypassing, tolerating, abandoning and overcoming. The first two stages contain stage-specific factors influencing the progression of service usage, and the final three stages contain stage-specific factors that matter in the decision to use or quit the service. As a new contribution, we propose a stage theory for explaining customers’ behavior following information technology-based service degradation. Our results outline new research directions in information technology-based service degradation, including further testing and refinement of our proposed theory in the case of different services.

 abstract = {The use of grounded theory method (GTM) as a research method in information systems (IS) has gradually increased over the years as qualitative research in general has become more prevalent. The method offers a systematic way to generate theory from data, but is rarely used to its full potential in IS as a number of myths and misunderstandings about GTM prevent researchers from getting the full potential out of the method. To address this problem, we advance the general level of knowledge of GTM. We clarify aspects of the method that are often misunderstood by novice users or casual observers and provide guidance to address common problems. Exemplars from the IS literature are used to illustrate the concepts and to promote the informed use of the methodology. By doing so, this paper will contribute to improving the use of the method and to the quality and dissemination of grounded theory research outcomes.},

Knowledge empowers people, while information technology integrates such knowledge for purposeful action and reaction. This paper describes a framework, based on social capital and knowledge management theories, which aims to further that debate in the field of information systems. The framework is primarily a sensitising device, designed to assist thinking about how social capital and knowledge theories facilitate ICT interventions for poverty reduction. The framework has four stages, the process of ICT development, the ICT intervention, the evaluation of the impact of the ICT intervention and the process of poverty reduction, which is the final and most contested stage of an ICT intervention. Each stage of the framework is discussed, using illustrations from various development projects. Finally, the paper draws some conclusions about the contribution of social capital and knowledge management theories to the issue of ICT intervention and evaluation in developing countries.},

 abstract = {Previous research has already established that compared to other types of investments, information technology (IT) investments are insufficiently or not at all evaluated. This can be partly explained by the lack of adequate IT evaluation methods and tools. In the case of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems whose effects on organizational processes and performance are intrinsically profound and wide-ranging compared to those of traditional IT limited to some spheres of organization, evaluation activities may be an issue of great concern. This study thus aims to propose and test an alternative evaluation method adaptable to the organizational context, making it possible to measure the contribution of an ERP system to organizational performance in all its aspects. Combining a process-based model and a scorecard model, the proposed method was first designed from a review of information systems evaluation literature. It has then been validated and refined through a multi-case study of manufacturing firms: an in-depth pilot case study was conducted, and thereafter the study was replicated on two other cases. Results show that the method proposed here enables organizations to determine the extent to which the firm's operational and overall performance has been impacted by the adoption and use of ERP systems, through the automational, informational, and transformational effects of ERP on their business processes. From a practical point of view, three contributions must be mentioned: the proposed method allows for a strong contextualization of its application, it is action-oriented, and it allows comparison across organizations even though organizational contexts may totally differ.},

 abstract = {This study applies the concept of organizational boundary to examine how outsourcing and the management of external and internal boundaries of the information technology (IT) function impact IT alignment. The article argues that by decreasing the governance costs for the less strategic IT transactions, IT outsourcing enables the IT function, and IT management particularly, to focus more on aligning the IT activities and plans with business strategies and priorities, and thereby improve IT alignment. This article also suggests that organizations may improve IT alignment by effectively transmitting knowledge and supporting collaboration between IT and business functions through boundary spanning activities and with boundary objects. The concept of organizational boundaries and boundary management has not been explicitly addressed by the existing research on IT alignment. This study also contributes to the IT outsourcing literature by linking outsourcing to improved IT alignment.},

@article{vandenHooffvanWeenenSoekijadEtAl2010,
 abstract = {This article addresses the question how networks of practice (NoPs) can create value (operationalized as their contribution to individual members’ performance) for organizations through knowledge integration and management. The discussion focuses on two sets of variables influencing member performance: the embeddedness of the network and the use of different media. Three dimensions of embeddedness are distinguished: (1) embeddedness in practice: the extent to which the knowledge shared in the network is integrated in members’ (local) practices; (2) structural embeddedness: the extent to which network members are connected to each other and know who knows what; and (3) relational embeddedness: the extent to which the network is characterized by strong social ties. In terms of communication media, information and communication technology (ICT)-enabled and face-to-face interaction are distinguished. A survey study among 206 members of different NoPs reveals that all three forms of embeddedness are important antecedents of NoP member performance (explaining 43% of the variance in performance) and that these forms are interrelated. Furthermore, ICT use positively influences embeddedness in practice, whereas face-to-face communication contributes to the structural and relational embeddedness of an NoP. This contributes to knowledge management and ICT literature in general and NoP theory in particular.},

 abstract = {Webservices (WSs) are believed to be among the key technologies to enable the transformation of current static supply chains into dynamic virtual networks of enterprises. Others have said that these technologies are not yet ready for large-scale applications to supply chains and propose ‘traditional’ cross-enterprise integration methods. However, there is currently little research available that objectively evaluates the usefulness of WSs to enable smart business networks. In this study, this question is addressed through developing a typical scenario in which we transform a static supply chain into a ‘loosely coupled’ business network. We implement the scenario using state-of-the-art ‘enterprise application integration’ and WSs orchestration technology. The comparison of these alternative approaches reveals that WSs technology has some clear advantages above enterprise integration technology currently in use. However, there are also some limitations and research issues which are presented as a future research agenda for WSs technology.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we offer an original framework to study Artificial Intelligence (AI). The perspective we propose is based on the idea that AI is a system technology, and that a useful description of AI cannot abstain from mapping the components of the system, their interdependence, and how the synergies they create shape at the roots the directions of AI development. We adopt the concept of Large Technical System (LTS) to give substance and structure to our idea. Using LTS, we are able to scaffold AI and the forces at work steering its production, deployment, and evolution. We find that AI as a system shares essential features with infrastructural technologies such as the Internet. The LTS framework proves very useful to capture important nuances of the technology, and it allows us to trace the connections and cross-influences among its constituting domains - algorithms (software), compute (hardware), and data. We compare our proposed framework with other concepts usually associated with radical innovations, and suggest in which respects AI differs from these ideal-types. We consider ours a timely exercise, as we witness the formation of an AI industry. While in the making, this industry is rapidly ossifying, together with its specific problems, power imbalances, and development scenarios; the focus on the system-ness of AI allows uncovering the deeper structure of this technological breakthrough.},

@article{vanOschSteinfield2016,
 abstract = {Recent team boundary spanning literature has recommended a shift toward assessing the role of virtual tools – such as social media. Simultaneously the proliferation of Enterprise Social Media (ESM) points to the need to theorize and investigate the supra-individual usage of these tools, such as their usefulness for organizational groups. This paper responds to both mandates through a theoretical integration of the team boundary spanning and existing ESM literature. Using data from two studies – one qualitative and one quantitative – this papers addresses two important research questions regarding the empirical relationship between team boundary spanning and ESM for understanding (i) the types of team boundary-spanning activities that group members enact through ESM and (ii) the effects of ESM on extra-team stakeholders' perceptions and reciprocating actions vis-à-vis the team boundary-spanning activities of these group members. The results of this study show that ESM, largely as a function of their visibility affordance, supports a narrow set of representational activities, but offers only limited support for information search and coordination. Furthermore, the findings reveal that ESM activity has a positive effect on extra-team stakeholders' recognition and financial support of the representational ESM posts emanating from the boundary-spanning group. Important implications for theory, strategy, and design are discussed.},

 abstract = {The determination of value of information or information systems is a basic issue for information management. In order to solve it several questions must be answered like: what is the object of valuation; how is value defined and measured; and what constitutes a coherent and usable method for valuation. In this paper an approach is outlined that combines the information commodity approach, activity-based costing, and graph modelling. The first is used to define the object of analysis (an information commodity) and the nature of value (the demand value at the marketplace). The third allows the modelling of business processes in terms of activities and cost relations between activities. The second enables the assignment of costs to activities modelled in the graph. Together they constitute a coherent and usable method for determining the value of IS. This is illustrated by means of a case study.},

 abstract = {This paper reflects on the managerialistic orthodoxy of knowledge management in order to show that a critical communications theory is required for addressing real political and ethical shortcomings. This produces an alternative methodological perspective through an intentional synthesis of established methodological views. The paper's allies in this critical quest include Jürgen Habermas, Werner Ulrich, Stanley Deetz, Geoffrey Vickers, Peter Checkland and their mentors. Information systems and knowledge systems architects and engineers and their manager clients conveniently ignore fundamental issues, including politics, power, knowledge and communication. Yet, today the more substantive issues are not technical but ethical. In raising questions about the rhetoric of knowledge management reflections on the instrumentality of much of what is said and done about management and information systems are outlined. The departure point is critical scepticism. This is motivated by concerns for the ethical status of the commercially valuable outcome of (at least) two conjoined simplistic and fundamentally dominatory conventional wisdoms. These stem from two fields that are managerialistically biased and which share a common basis in a false rationality.},

@article{VegaChiassonBrown2008,
 abstract = {Given the importance of contextual influences on the diffusion of innovations, the theories and methodologies that take context into account are increasingly relevant to research and practice. One such approach, the systems of innovation approach, considers context to be a cascading set of effects arising from various participants and innovations surrounding the production and diffusion of a focal innovation. Based on this approach, we focus on a public program involved in the diffusion of e-business systems to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). E-business systems are complex innovations, and the contextual influences are particularly important here, because SMEs often lack the knowledge and resources to strategically adopt, modify, and use these innovations. Using the systems of innovation approach, we examined the contexts around public program interventions with an SME in order to explain their form and influence on e-business adoption processes. The empirical findings suggest that many public programs fail to effectively deliver interventions because program contexts restrict program personnel's ability to completely assess and respond to the range of adopter needs. While some aspects of the program contexts can be altered by the program directors, others are further removed and are currently beyond our collective control at this point-in-time. The implications for diffusion research and practice are discussed.},

The need for such a review derives from the conceptual difficulties and empirical limitations observed in past research, and from the management challenge of rapidly growing new information technologies (ITs). Our review systematizes the objectives and cost accounting methods underlying past developments in this area. We describe the features of successful chargeout systems, recognizing the current neglect of organizational-level objectives and follow this with a discussion of the advantages of chargeout systems, and the problems involved in their use. An investigation into the context of new ITs reveals a new surge of chargeout software products that require more organizationally oriented chargeout research. Finally, we present a model of chargeout systems evolution within a wider managerial and business context.},

@article{ViaeneDeHertogh2010,
 abstract = {In 2003, Rob Carter, CIO of international express courier FedEx, launched the ‘Six by Six’ (6 × 6) IT transformation program: a major rationalization and centralization effort to improve FedEx's IT service delivery to its business partners. This teaching case deals with the 6 × 6 efforts made by the IT department for Europe, Middle East, Indian sub-continent and Africa (EMEA). The case focuses on two objectives of the 6 × 6 program: (a) creating a consistent IT environment and (b) increasing delivery bandwidth to the business. Historically, FedEx Express in EMEA had granted high levels of empowerment to local business and IT people. Moreover, FedEx had always supported a ‘can-do’ mentality In both business and IT people. Consequently, the IT department was expected to keep the enterprise systems architecture resilient and supportive of longer-term enterprise growth, while keeping the IT development pipeline aligned with the often unpredictable stream of requests from empowered business constituents. The story begins in 2007, when a new Vice President for IT was appointed for the region. Part A deals with the IT department's efforts to set up a central systems architecture and IT resource estimation review process. Part B deals with demand-side prioritization issues. The suggested teaching plan assumes that Part A is discussed before the students receive Part B. Instructors can use this case to introduce their students to a realistic view on the complex puzzle of establishing enterprise-wide business-IT engagement patterns through IT governance in an empowered and operations-focused business environment.},

@article{VidgenWang2006,
 abstract = {New technologies, notably service-oriented architectures and Web services, are enabling a third wave of business process management (BPM). Supporters claim that BPM is informed by complexity theory and that business processes can evolve and adapt to changing business circumstances. It is suggested by BPM adherents that the business/IT divide will be obliterated through a process-centric approach to systems development. The evolution of BPM and its associated technologies are explored and then coevolutionary theory is used to understand the business/IT relationship. Specifically, Kauffman's NKC model is applied to a business process ecosystem to bring out the implications of coevolution for the theory and practice of BPM and for the relationship between business and IT. The paper argues that a wider view of the business process ecosystem is needed to take account of the social perspective as well as the human/non-human dimension.},

 abstract = {With changes in both technology and the environment, Nortel has had to evolve from a company that sells a collection of telecommunication products to a company that sells integrated packages of products which satisfy specific customer needs. In the past Information Systems (IS) was spread across the various product divisions, supporting a highly decentralized corporate structure. Now it has been charged with transforming itself to facilitate the company's need for greater integration, including a move to standardized systems. IS must redefine its role and restructure itself to fulfil its new mandate. After an extensive analysis and design exercise, the IS function has been revisualized as centring on three key processes: client management, solution delivery and business support. This represents a significant change from a traditional IS shop that focuses on building applications and infrastructure. While there is broad support for the changes in principle, actually getting the new processes fully articulated and implemented presents a significant challenge.},

 abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is beginning to transform traditional research practices in many areas. In this context, literature reviews stand out because they operate on large and rapidly growing volumes of documents, that is, partially structured (meta)data, and pervade almost every type of paper published in information systems research or related social science disciplines. To familiarize researchers with some of the recent trends in this area, we outline how AI can expedite individual steps of the literature review process. Considering that the use of AI in this context is in an early stage of development, we propose a comprehensive research agenda for AI-based literature reviews (AILRs) in our field. With this agenda, we would like to encourage design science research and a broader constructive discourse on shaping the future of AILRs in research.},

 abstract = {We investigate information systems (IS) projects as a liminal space ‘betwixt and between’ the status quo and the new environment, using a case study of the implementation of an enterprise system (ES). This liminal space provides a stabilizing platform whereupon the project team can develop new and potentially transformative IS. However, after a project team has completed its initial IS design for roll-out, this liminal space must be bridged to incorporate process-generated learning and new systems back into the organizational working environment. We demonstrate how this bridging involves negotiations that attempt to reconcile divergent perspectives by adopting a conciliatory or peacemaking attitude. As such, our analysis focuses on the IS project as a multi-phased process that includes the creation of a liminal space for the project team during development and on the negotiations that ensure the ES becomes a working IS in the post-implementation environment.},

 abstract = {This paper proposes an adapted diffusion of innovation (DOI) framework that may be considered relevant and useful to researchers undertaking studies of information systems innovations in healthcare organizations. A particular focus concerns problems and issues associated with professional cultures and powerful organizational control structures. A review of four empirical DOI studies are undertaken to identify candidate frameworks for the retrospective analysis of a pilot study conducted across General Medical Practices based within a Primary Care Trust in the north east of England. A research approach, based on phenomenology, semi-structured interviews and template analysis is adopted in order to conduct and provide a rich analysis of the data. The findings are discussed using the modified DOI framework. Discussion and conclusions relate to the extended use of the DOI framework, its further development and how it may be used to understand how ICT innovation is politically constrained, perceived and motivated within healthcare environments},

Some reasons for their relative success and failure are analysed, and impacts on the empowerment of staff and management control are discussed. These issues are related to a simple categorization of decentralized information systems dependent on their primary purpose and the approach taken to their design and implementation. Some conclusions are drawn on future desirable approaches to the development of large-scale decentralized information systems in a developing country context, and on the possible impacts of such systems for the empowerment of different social groups.},

@article{Walsham2012a,
 abstract = {Dramatic changes in context have occurred over the last 25 years for those of us working in the information systems (IS) field, with ICTs becoming pervasive in many areas of human activity and in all countries of the world. It is ironic that the success of ICTs has led to concerns that the distinct research contribution of the IS field could become lost and that the field itself may decline. The literature over the last decade or so has offered different and sometimes opposing suggestions as to how the field should respond to these concerns. In this paper, I discuss these debates and I use the discussion as a basis for putting forward a skeleton future agenda for the IS field as a whole. This agenda emphasises the need for a focus on ethical goals, increased use of critical approaches, welcoming other disciplines with open arms, widening our field of study to many nontraditional settings and rejecting a dominant methodological paradigm.},

 abstract = {The types of benefits which a business can obtain from investments in information Systems (IS) have developed and become more varied over time. During that same period many organizations have become dependent on their Information Systems in terms of how they do business and some have used IS to gain competitive or strategic advantages. This article explores the nature of the benefits that can accrue in relation to the business objectives of IS investments. A portfolio model is discussed which helps management evaluate the relative importance of such investments to the business and hence to define how each investment can be appraised and managed. In order to maintain a coherent strategy for managing IS investments, not only must they all be evaluated on a consistent basis, but priorities amongst the applications must be established on the same set of criteria. Again the portfolio approach enables management to address this issue in a rational way, based on business needs and imperatives.},

It is argued through the cyber-ethnographic examination of two virtual communities that, interpretative research methods traditionally associated with the social sciences enforce preconceived ideas and normative frameworks on to the virtual community. Cyber-ethnography allows a reflexive methodology to emerge, thus enabling the participants of virtual communities to define their own reality and perimeters. It is propounded that there are two elements to the virtual community. First, it is emphasized that a hybrid space is rapidly emerging that is neither absolutely physical or virtual. Through its convergence with the physical the virtual community's existence is apparent, though not unconditionally virtual. Secondly, the participants are depicted as having a transitory, unconditional relationship with the virtual community. That is; they will only participate for short periods when they require use of the resources that the virtual community has to offer.},

 abstract = {The integration of information systems (IS) is a phrase which is commonly used in both research and practice within the IS field and across many organizational contexts. This paper uses a historical review to explore how the image of integrated IS has been constructed, evolved over three decades and how this has resulted in the widespread acceptance of idealized goals and benefits. A literature search for an underlying theoretical basis for the concept of systems integration is made, highlighting a diversity of opinion. Two case studies are used to examine the meaning of integration relative to the images and ideals, theory and reality. The study concludes that there is an urgent need for better conceptual and theoretical models of integration to enable more effective discourse of the concept. These models must also encompass and include more diverse non-technical factors for the adoption of more complex forms of IS.},

 abstract = {The imperatives on contemporary organizations to adapt to an increasingly uncertain and turbulent environment are intense. The pace of change is at least as great in the public as the private sector, with technology being integral to the UK government's modernization agenda. Resilience refers to the ability of individuals and organizations to cope with change through a continuous process of renewal. Much research on resilience is uncritical, normative and written from a detached perspective that emphasizes the agency of senior management. In contrast, this paper provides an ethnographically based account of resilience at the middle level of a large, public sector bureaucracy. Finding itself under increasing pressure to move away from its traditional, technically oriented role, the IS function sought to reinvent itself as a strategic driver of business transformation. The development of a business process reengineering methodology was seen as the key to operationalizing this new role. Although innovation in IS methodology can be problematic, here it was brought off successfully. This was attributed to several factors, including the adoption of a participative action research approach and the commitment of IS management. Above all, the sense of crisis prevailing at the outset of the initiative was decisive. Crises present a major challenge to organizational sense-making; here, a resilient ‘discourse of renewal’ was kindled with the impending threat interpreted positively as a proactive opportunity to develop the new strategic identity. The paper concludes with some critical reflections on the limits of managerial agency and the notion of resilience as a designable capacity.},

The survey revealed that manufacturing firms exhibited an intermediate degree of IS sophistication. Typically they were situated in the ‘contagion’ and ‘control’ stages of Nolan's stages of growth model, although a minority of firms were significantly more advanced. Organizational size was found to influence the degree of IS sophistication with larger firms manifesting a more highly developed information processing capacity. The influence of a number of factors on project success was investigated. Companies using their own formal methodologies for software development achieved higher than average rates of success. The degree of awareness of the strategic potential of IT was also positively correlated with success.},

 abstract = {This paper considers how a methodology's theory and practice shapes contexts for interpretation. With these two terms as starting points, we also address a paradoxical situation: any description of interpreting contexts is bound to leave something out. To address this, we propose deconstruction as a double strategy for critically interpreting contexts in each situation. This relies on terms of existing oppositions in conceptual frameworks but seeks to displace the limitations they impose on how we conduct inquiry. Since meaning is context-bound but contexts are boundless, we argue that inquiry should be conducted through critical perspectives, and we describe this in terms of a systems analyst's expertise in conceptual triangulation: the defining of an unknown point in relation to two known extremes.},

 abstract = {All Decision Support Systems (DSS) are, by their nature, designed to improve decision making effectiveness, yet a review of the experimental literature reveals that achievement of this objective is mixed. We propose that this is because DSS effectiveness is contingent upon a number of factors related to the task and DSS under investigation. This paper reports a longitudinal experiment designed to evaluate the relationship between DSS effectiveness and two such factors: DSS sophistication and task complexity. In comparison to unaided human judgement, two levels of DSS were evaluated: a deterministic spreadsheet model and a probabilistic model with a graphical risk analysis aid. Our subjects made decisions in a business simulation providing two successive phases of increasing task complexity. Initially, when task complexity was low, we found that neither DSS affected subjects’ performance. In the more complex phase, both types of DSS users performed significantly better than unaided subjects. However, risk analysis users performed no better than model-only users. Interestingly, DSS users performed less homogeneously than unaided subjects in the complex phase. DSS users had greater confidence and considered more alternatives than their unaided counterparts. Risk analysis users took longer making decisions in the early stages, while model-only users became the most efficient in the later stages.},

 abstract = {There is a plethora of theories to explore the disciplines of business, management and sociology, with institutional theory being widely used to explore a range of research challenges. In the area of Information Systems (IS), the use of institutional theory remains in its infancy, with much potential for adoption. Much of the rationale underpinning the proposed research is that a systematic review and synthesis of the normative literature may support the direction of further research and the use of institutional theory in exploring pertinent research challenges facing the IS community. This study also serves to signpost cross-disciplinary research, and thus opens up a whole new research paradigm. Therefore, this article seeks to provide a bibliometric analysis and a comprehensive and systematic review of the literature pertaining to institutional theory to ascertain the current ‘state of play’ of the theory. Information on a series of variables was extracted after conducting a review of 511 articles across various disciplines that have utilised institutional theory, published in 210 peer-reviewed journals between 1978 and 2008. The findings suggest that the positivist paradigm, empirical and quantitative research, the survey method and organisation/firm as a unit of analysis was used predominantly in combination with institutional theory. The results of this study may have implications for researchers, journal editors, reviewers and universities.},

 abstract = {Managing platform ecosystems requires providers to govern the permeability of platform boundaries in order to strike a balance between openness and control. But is it worthwhile for platform providers to conduct screening processes for third-party offerings, or should they rather apply a laissez-faire approach and let the market determine winners and losers? In this study, we compare the market conditions on Kickstarter, one of the world's largest crowdfunding platforms, before and after a policy change that relaxed the previously stringent screening process for new campaigns. By analyzing over 230,000 crowdfunding campaigns with a combined funding of over $1.9 billion that cover a 4-year period around the policy change, we find that increasing platform openness was a double-edged sword for the platform's ecosystem. While Kickstarter's revenue from commissions surged after the policy change due to an increase in the number of campaigns available on the platform, funding conditions for project creators and backers deteriorated. Project creators have to cope with lower success rates and an intensified competition due to a growing disproportion of backers to campaigns, while backers face higher uncertainties as project creators invest less in reducing information asymmetries. Our evidence from this natural experiment therefore suggests that increasing platform openness for third-party offerings can destabilize a platform's ecosystem. We thus extend the literature on platform openness and on the implications of policy changes on platform ecosystems. Our findings also provide practical insights for different platform stakeholders into possible “ripple effects” that are triggered when policy changes alter platform openness.},

 abstract = {Research into information systems development (ISD) methodologies is generally restricted to the creation or elaboration of methodologies or the provision of CASE support. This paper proposes that a fruitful area of research, which will provide insights into the effectiveness of ISD methodologies, must centre on the observation of the practice of systems developers, users and managers, and the study of methodologies in use. Such a programme requires certain techniques, ideally longitudinal ethnographic case studies. Preliminary results from a couple of case studies indicate that ISD methodologies are not used as prescribed but this does not necessarily prevent the successful completion of development projects.},

@article{Whelan2007,
 abstract = {The recently developed knowledge-based view of the firm argues that knowledge is the firm's most valuable resource. Within this field of study, informal social networks are rapidly gaining attention as mechanisms that facilitate knowledge flows. Electronic networks of practice (NoPs) are a special case of informal network where the sharing of practice-related knowledge occurs primarily through computer-based communication technologies. However, we know relatively little about the dynamics of knowledge exchange that occur in these electronic networks. This conceptual paper posits that there is a relationship between the structural properties of electronic NoPs and successful knowledge exchange. The theoretical positions of social network theory and the knowledge-based view of the firm are used to support this claim. A review of the extant literature reveals that a clear conceptual framework for NoPs is lacking. The objective of this research is to contribute to the development of such a framework by addressing a largely neglected area within the growing network of practice literature – namely, the relationship between electronic network communication structure and knowledge flows.},

It does this through a series of hermeneutic readings of the situation, which develop an increasingly satisfactory understanding of the complexities of the development process. The paper begins by describing the case study site and the market that it operates within before considering the role of corporate culture on entrepreneurial firms of this kind. The first reading of the situation, using participative methods and the sociology of translation, is then presented and a critique of the limitations of this reading is presented. A second reading, drawing on Heidegger's ideas as applied to the notion of entrepreneurship, is then presented. This second reading proves to be far more satisfactory and the paper ends with a summary and reflections on the process of making a series of readings of the development process at the case study site.},

@article{WhitleyDarking2006,
 abstract = {In this paper, we explore some of Claudio Ciborra's ideas about the technological object. We do this in contrast to recent analysis by Law and Singleton (L&S) that advocates a methodological radicalism that moves beyond epistemological uncertainties about the technological object to ontological concerns. L&S present a series of stages in this analysis that include fluid objects that change relatively gently and fire objects that have more radical discontinuities. This approach is applied to empirical work studying the engagement practices of a large, sophisticated information infrastructure research project, the Digital Business Ecosystem (DBE). At the start of the DBE engagement process, the DBE was an invisible technology that did not exist and this made the process of engagement with it particularly challenging. Drawing on the analysis presented by, however, the DBE appears to have the ontological characteristics of both the fluid and the fire object. In order to address this dilemma, we draw upon Ciborra's thinking, particularly around the information infrastructure and Gestell as a means that allows us to consider technologies like the DBE as being both fluid and fire objects. The paper ends with a discussion of the implications of this work on Claudio Ciborra's legacy for the study of information and communications technologies.},

@article{Willcocks2020,
 abstract = {Robotics and the automation of knowledge work, often referred to as AI (artificial intelligence), are presented in the media as likely to have massive impacts, for better or worse, on jobs skills, organizations and society. The article deconstructs the dominant hype-and-fear narrative. Claims on net job loss emerge as exaggerated, but there will be considerable skills disruption and change in the major global economies over the next 12 years. The term AI has been hijacked, in order to suggest much more going on technologically than can be the case. The article reviews critically the research evidence so far, including the author’s own, pointing to eight major qualifiers to the dominant discourse of major net job loss from a seamless, overwhelming AI wave sweeping fast through the major economies. The article questions many assumptions: that automation creates few jobs short or long term; that whole jobs can be automated; that the technology is perfectible; that organizations can seamlessly and quickly deploy AI; that humans are machines that can be replicated; and that it is politically, socially and economically feasible to apply these technologies. A major omission in all studies is factoring in dramatic increases in the amount of work to be done. Adding in ageing populations, productivity gaps and skills shortages predicted across many G20 countries, the danger might be too little, rather than too much labour. The article concludes that, if there is going to be a Robo-Apocalypse, this will be from a collective failure to adjust to skills change over the next 12 years. But the debate needs to be widened to the impact of eight other technologies that AI insufficiently represents in the popular imagination and that, in combination, could cause a techno-apocalypse.},

 abstract = {Robotics and the automation of knowledge work, often referred to as AI (artificial intelligence), are presented in the media as likely to have massive impacts, for better or worse, on jobs skills, organizations and society. The article deconstructs the dominant hype-and-fear narrative. Claims on net job loss emerge as exaggerated, but there will be considerable skills disruption and change in the major global economies over the next 12 years. The term AI has been hijacked, in order to suggest much more going on technologically than can be the case. The article reviews critically the research evidence so far, including the author’s own, pointing to eight major qualifiers to the dominant discourse of major net job loss from a seamless, overwhelming AI wave sweeping fast through the major economies. The article questions many assumptions: that automation creates few jobs short or long term; that whole jobs can be automated; that the technology is perfectible; that organizations can seamlessly and quickly deploy AI; that humans are machines that can be replicated; and that it is politically, socially and economically feasible to apply these technologies. A major omission in all studies is factoring in dramatic increases in the amount of work to be done. Adding in ageing populations, productivity gaps and skills shortages predicted across many G20 countries, the danger might be too little, rather than too much labour. The article concludes that, if there is going to be a Robo-Apocalypse, this will be from a collective failure to adjust to skills change over the next 12 years. But the debate needs to be widened to the impact of eight other technologies that AI insufficiently represents in the popular imagination and that, in combination, could cause a techno-apocalypse.},

 abstract = {The National Health Service has embarked upon major initiatives to bring in management and financial information systems capable of relating resource usage to cost and to underpin better management and effective delivery of health care. This paper identifies a range of weaknesses and impending problem areas in implementation practice. Recent research evidence from several NHS regions is utilized to support the detailed case made for changes in how computer-based projects are developed, managed and implemented within the organization. It is suggested that the evidence and analysis would seem to have implications for all those studying, experiencing, or anticipating computerization.},

 abstract = {This paper investigates perceptions of the IT/business relationship held by 653 IT managers and their staff and 503 of their business counterparts. On the basis of data collected over a 3-year period using a survey instrument, the paper highlights areas of perceived difficulty in the IT/business relationship and seeks evidence of trends in the business/IT relationship. The data reveal significant differences in the perceptions of business managers and those of IT professionals, especially with respect to issues of IT system efficacy and communication efficacy. Both cohorts demonstrate increasing awareness of the importance of IT as a driver of business activity, as well as comparable upward or downward trends in response on issues relating to IT's alignment with business strategy and communication efficacy, but only the first mentioned issue is identified as a statistically significant trend.},

 abstract = {The high level of investigative activity to date into information systems and information technology acceptance and diffusion has witnessed the use of a wide range of exploratory techniques, examining many different systems and technologies in countless different contexts and geographical locations. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive and systematic review of the literature pertaining to such adoption and diffusion issues in order to observe trends, ascertain the current ‘state of play’, and to highlight promising lines of inquiry including those lacking investigative activity or simply being in need of renewed interest. Previous research activity was analysed along a number dimensions including units of analysis, research paradigms, methodologies, and methods, theories and theoretical constructs, and technologies/contexts examined. Information on these and other variables was extracted during an examination of 345 papers on innovation adoption, acceptance and diffusion appearing in 19 peer-reviewed journals between 1985 and 2007. Findings suggest that the positivist paradigm, empirical and quantitative research, the survey method and Technology Acceptance Model theory (and its associated constructs) were predominantly used in the body of work examined, revealing clear opportunities for researchers to make original contributions by making greater use of the theoretical and methodological variety available to them, and consequently reducing the risk of research in the area moving toward overall homogeneity.},

@article{WilliamsTsang2015,
 abstract = {Lee and Baskerville (2003) attempted to clarify the concept of generalization and classify it into four types. In Tsang and Williams (2012) we objected to their account of generalization as well as their classification and offered repairs. Then we proposed a classification of induction, within which we distinguished five types of generalization. In their (2012) rejoinder, they argue that their classification is compatible with ours, claiming that theirs offers a ‘new language.’ Insofar as we resist this ‘new language’ and insofar as they think that our position commits us to positivism and the rejection of interpretivism, they conclude both that our classification is more restrictive than theirs and also that we embrace ‘paradigmatic domination.’ Lee and Baskerville's classification of generalization is based on a distinction between theoretical and empirical statements. Accordingly we will first clarify the terms ‘theoretical statement’ and ‘empirical statement.’ We note that they find no fault with our classification of induction, we restate our main objections to their classification that remain unanswered and we show that their classification of generalizing is in fact incompatible with ours. We argue that their account of generalization retains fatal flaws, which means it should not be relied upon. We demonstrate that our classification is not committed to any paradigm and so we do not embrace ‘paradigmatic domination.’},

 abstract = {This paper aims to attend the under-theorisation of gender within the Information Systems (IS) literature by adopting a critical and feminist approach to the organisational context of IS development and use. The IS are conceived of as innovations with theoretical concepts and observations for comprehending the innovation process advanced within Social Studies of Technology being described and applied to IS. Consequently, a conceptual framework for studying gender and IS is constructed by combining insights derived from: (1) gender and computing, concerning the differences and inequalities of development and use of IS; (2) gender and society concerning the existence of gendered spheres; (3) studies of gender and organisations concerning the social division of labour; and (4) gender and technology, concerning the masculinity of technology culture. The developed framework is tabulated, areas for future research suggested and potential research questions outlined. The latter employ examples from the field of nursing to illustrate their tangible application. The framework constitutes a contribution to IS research by providing access to additional explanations for organisational phenomena (such as user rejection); by deepening our understanding of the innovation process; by improving IS practice through increased awareness of social issues (especially gender); and by promoting further potential topics for IS researchers.},

The first part of the paper examines the nature of the accounting environment and identifies a number of reasons why accounting automation should be an issue of general concern. A particular accounting task, auditing, is examined in detail to illustrate some of the factors affecting accounting automation. The second part of the paper reports the findings of an empirical examination of computerization amongst a number of different accounting groups with different working environments. Practitioners’ views on several factors constraining further technological innovation, and on factors motivating innovation, are analysed and examined. It is concluded that domain characteristics, historical factors and skill availability are amongst the most significant variables influencing automation.},

Well-crafted problems are the foundation for mobilizing the effort, resources, and attention essential to scientific progress and broader impact. We argue that Information Systems (IS) scholars, individually and collectively, must develop the practice of articulating and engaging large-scale, broad scope problems – or grand challenges. To support this position, we examine the role and value of grand challenge efforts in science and engineering based on a theory of grand challenges as socially constructed boundary objects. Conceptualizing grand challenges in these terms implies strategies and approaches for magnifying the impact of IS research by engaging these types of problems.},

It brings together business and technology managers, by providing, at one level, a tool they can use for scoring systems. At another level, it offers a decision-making process that provides a number of key benefits, such as improved communications. Two case studies, from the public and private sectors, show two different, practical uses of the Information Economics approach, and how it can be adapted to different organizations.},

@article{WolfBeckPahlke2012,
 abstract = {Environmental turbulence (ET), as exemplified by the recent financial crisis between 2007 and 2009, leads to a high degree of uncertainty, and fosters mimicry and resulting bandwagon phenomena in information technology (IT) innovation assimilation processes. In these highly turbulent environments, ‘mindless’ IT innovation assimilation by participating organizations plays a major role in the manifestation and facilitation of mimetic influences. Even in less turbulent economic cycles, highly turbulent industries such as the financial services industry have to deal with demanding IT innovation assimilation processes, and are exposed to varying levels of ET and mimicry. Drawing upon the theory of dynamic capabilities, organizational mindfulness (OM) is one viable means to mitigate the potentially negative consequences of mimetic behaviour. Here, mindful organizations are more successful in overcoming situations of high dynamism, and sometimes are even able to exploit them. So far, little empirical research has been conducted to quantify the influence of OM in scenarios of high dynamism and mimicry. On the basis of 302 complete responses from senior IT managers in the financial services industry from the Anglo-Saxon countries (the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom), this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the interaction of OM with institutional pressures against the background of ET.},

 abstract = {User participation in information system development is considered to be an important factor influencing implementation success or failure. The ETHICS (Effective Technical and Human Implementation of Computer-based Systems) method was developed as a guide to user involvement in system design. A case study of successful implementation which did not use the ETHICS method explicitly is described. The case study and the ETHICS methodology are then compared and contrasted in an attempt to gain greater insight into user participation and to understand why the implementation was successful. Furthermore, techniques of software process modelling are applied to both ETHICS and the case study with the intention of more closely defining the user participation process and potentially also guiding it in future developments. The case study is used as a vehicle both to examine user participation and also to investigate the modelling of user participation.},

 abstract = {ICT innovation is known to significantly elevate a country's growth and to enhance productivity. It is now well-acknowledged that emerging economies are beginning to innovate at a rapid rate despite some of the challenges they face. Given that these countries with such economies now comprise a third of the world's largest 25 economies, and that they are likely to be critical for the success of a global economy, it is important to understand how these economies innovate, what factors affect innovation in such nations, and what are the impacts. However, to the best of our knowledge, little research till date has been conducted on this topic, and the few existing studies have failed to catch the attention of the mainstream IS research community. We believe that the absence of studies is primarily due to a lack of understanding of what has been found with respect to ICT innovation in emerging economies, what needs to be studied, and how they should be studied. We attempt to contribute in this area by: (1) providing a comprehensive framework of existing research on ICT innovation in emerging economies, (2) highlighting the gaps that have been left behind, and (3) providing specific guidelines to future researchers, including a research model summarizing the salient issues that need examination. We believe that our study makes an important contribution to research on ICT innovation in emerging economies, and can be a useful resource for future researchers interested in this topic.},

In this study, we conceptualized the use of Instant messaging in social network-facilitated team collaboration as an Intentional social action and further Investigated the effect of gender differences In the development of we-intention (I. e. collective intention) to engage In such collaboration. A research model was developed and empirically tested with 482 university students In Mainland China. The results demonstrated that the effects of attitude, positive anticipated emotions, and group norms on we-intention were more Important for men, whereas the effects of social Identity and negative anticipated emotions were more significant for women to collectively participate In social network-facilitated team collaboration. We believe the Implications of this study would shed considerable light on both research and practice.},

The programme incentives include information technology (IT) seminars, the provision of technical expertise in the forms of advisers and consultants and various financial subsidies and loans. This paper presents the results of a formal evaluation of the impact of the SECP based on the views of various participants in the programme, including chief executive officers (CEOs) of small businesses, technical advisers, consultants, IT vendors and programme administrators. A programme evaluation methodology is utilized in this study. The main finding is that the government programme has lowered the barriers to computerization and aided small businesses that lack the resources to computerize successfully. More efforts need to be expended in promoting this programme to other small businesses that suffer from resource poverty. There is a lack of knowledge of the existence of the computerization programme and a lack of appreciation of the programme.},

@article{YaylaHu2011,
 abstract = {The stock market reactions to information technology (IT)-related events have often been used as proxies to the value or cost of these events in the information systems literature. In this paper, we study the stock market reactions to information-security-related events using the event analysis methodology with consideration of the effects of a number of contingency factors, including business type, industry, type of breach, event year, and length of event window. We found that pure e-commerce firms experienced higher negative market reactions than traditional bricks-and-mortar firms in the event of security breach. We also found that denial of service attacks had higher negative impact than other types of security breaches. Finally, security events occurred in recent years were found to have less significant impact than those occurred earlier, suggesting that investors may have become less sensitive to the security events. Most interestingly, our analyses showed that the magnitude and longevity of security breaches vary with time across sub-samples. This raises some serious questions regarding the validity of analyzing only short-term stock market reactions as an indicator of the cost of security breaches, and in general, an indicator of the value of IT-related events. The implications of these results are discussed and potential future research directions are proposed.},

To do this, we identify the different assumptions regarding the implementation context implicit in the two theories and, based on these differences, develop a contingent model within which to integrate the two theories. A partial test of the model within one particular context is reported using data collected from the end-users of an IS innovation introduced in a State health system in Australia. As hypothesized, we find that, within the context, characterized by high individual level impact and low group level impact, the contribution of innovation characteristics to implementation success is higher than that of implementation process.},

These characteristics influence the nature of approach to be used in the development of any decision aids to support the process. This paper presents an approach adopted in the development of a DSS to support complex decision making in a Public Sector body. The approach incorporates the use of Soft System Methodology (SSM). The role of SSM in Information Systems in general and in the development of DSS in particular is not well understood. This paper attempts to enhance this understanding by presenting the role of SSM in the development life cycle. SSM was found to be useful especially at the initial stage of DSS development, namely in understanding the problem area, as well as in identifying models and information to be used as inputs to the DSS design.},

 abstract = {This paper examines the application of the concepts and research derived from studies of dysfunctional and addictive social behaviours to the implementation of change in an organizational arena. The majority of work on change management and, more specifically, re-engineering has been dominated by an emphasis on technical issues and macro-constructs that are important components in achieving successful process-change programmes. However, is it increasingly recognized that the emphasis on these is the cause of widespread disappointment with business process re-engineering. This paper argues that the management of the human and sociopolitical issues of change is a critical factor in determining the success or failure of process-re-engineering projects. It further suggests a methodology that may facilitate examination of these issues within any particular organization, based upon an organizational addictive model, which is developed in this paper.},

 abstract = {Corporate data protection malpractices are not uncommon, especially in contemporary technological environments. Embracing a regulatory view, this study attempts to advance a taxonomy of prevailing corporate data protection practices and their causal mechanisms by analyzing cases where organizations were fined for violating data protection legislation. Selecting the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) enacted by the European Union (EU) as our benchmark, this study employs an iterative taxonomy development technique as guidance and conducts a thematic analysis on 875 cases of GDPR enforcement. In so doing, we derive a conceptual model comprising 6 focal categories and 28 subcategories of prevailing corporate data protection malpractices existing within organizations as well as 4 main categories and 22 subcategories of causal mechanisms underlying these identified malpractices. Empirical findings from this study not only reinforce corporate data protection malpractices established in prior research but also yield novel malpractices that have been neglected in previous work. From a pragmatic standpoint, this study yields invaluable insights into the prevention and resolution of corporate data protection malpractices for practitioners.},

 abstract = {There is ample evidence of deviations between the actual and planned interaction structures between a firm's IT department and business units. Such deviations can hinder senior managers from governing their IT organizations effectively because they do not know how work really gets done. This paper develops an explanation for why actual structures differ from planned structures. Understanding this phenomenon is indispensable for managers to govern the real organization, to uphold compliance with important standards (e.g., ITIL, COBIT), to decide whether the formal or the actual organization is more effective, and, finally, to identify management actions that support the optimal structure. To develop this understanding, we analyze the interaction structures at the interface between firms’ business units and IT units in four rich cases, using data from 56 interviews and 47 questionnaires, and applying qualitative methods and social network analysis, which give us deep insights into planned and actual interaction among employees. We test two different explanations for deviations of actual from planned interaction structures and find that boundary-spanning theory provides the dominant explanation for such deviations: Inclined to span the business/IT boundary most effectively, the actors involved deviate from planned structures especially when other structures offer better boundary-spanning potential, which is influenced primarily by cross-domain knowledge. In addition, relationships also play an important role. On the positive side, relationships provide opportunities for such deviations, while on the negative side, a conflict-laden relationship might hinder deviations even if they were advantageous.},

 abstract = {The challenge of managing the relationship between a firm's business and IT in order to derive business value from IT is an important topic on researchers’ and practitioners’ agendas. The focus of most related research and management actions has been on the top management or project management levels. However, conflicts frequently arise within the line organization when applications are extended, enhanced, maintained, or otherwise changed operationally outside software development projects. This study focuses on the impact of relationships at the application-change level and strives to identify and explain favorable social structures for effective business/IT dialog at the operational level. We collected data in seven comprehensive case studies, including 88 interviews and corresponding surveys, and applied social network analysis to show that three social structures at the implementation level influence the degree to which IT applications are maintained and enhanced in line with business requirements: (1) interface actors connecting business and IT, (2) the relationships between interface actors and the corresponding unit, and (3) the relationships between interface actors and other employees in their unit. In three cases, less favorable structures are revealed that correspond to low application change effectiveness and software applications that do not meet business requirements. The other cases benefit from favorable social structures and thus enhance fulfillment of business requirements and result in higher IT business value. This paper contributes to IS research by helping to explain why companies may not provide favorable IT services despite favorable relationships at the top management level and successful application development projects.},

Varian asserts four uses that follow from computer-mediated transactions: data extraction and analysis,’ ‘new contractual forms due to better monitoring,’ ‘personalization and customization, ’ and continuous experiments. ’ An examination of the nature and consequences of these uses sheds light on the implicit logic of surveillance capitalism and the global architecture of computer mediation upon which it depends. This architecture produces a distributed and largely uncontested new expression of power that I christen: Big Other. ’ It is constituted by unexpected and often illegible mechanisms of extraction, commodification, and control that effectively exile persons from their own behavior while producing new markets of behavioral prediction and modification. Surveillance capitalism challenges democratic norms and departs in key ways from the centuries-long evolution of market capitalism.},

This phenomenon, which we refer to as ‘internal crowdsourcing’, is distinct both from external crowdsourcing with end users and from hierarchy-based work with employees. A literature stream has emerged that corresponds with the increased relevance of internal crowdsourcing in practice. The purpose of this review paper of internal crowdsourcing is to provide conceptual development, synthesise the literature, and provide a research agenda. In the review reported in this paper, we systematically analysed and critically reviewed the literature in this domain published thus far (74 papers). We found useful findings and insights into a new and relevant IT-enabled phenomenon. At the same time, we also found conflicting definitions and conceptualisation, as well as research efforts that are not well integrated. The paper supports future research on internal crowdsourcing by providing improved conceptualisation, consolidating insights, and identifying important areas for future research.},

 abstract = {Investment in knowledge management (KM) programmes is often contentious due to the challenge of meeting the need for continuous and sustainable benefits realization. In KM, the word ‘sustainable’ describes how programmes of strategies to leverage organizational knowledge remain productive over time: that they deliver strategic value to the organization. The focus of this paper falls on the constructs of the governance of KM and on its leadership, in KM strategy devopment and implementation, including risk management, financial controls and transparent evaluation mechanisms for continuous benefits realization. This paper presents a KM governance model and explores its recent validation through six case studies of large, distributed, multinational organizations, and through these introduces the granular constructs of KM governance. Exploration of the impact of KM governance on developing and implementing KM programmes in each case study organization demonstrates that there is a clear nexus between strategic KM governance and benefits realized from those programmes.},
